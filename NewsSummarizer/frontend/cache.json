So Alonso goes again, Sainz shuts the door \u2026 BUT ALONSO FORCES IT OPEN AGAIN! Ah man, this is great to see, the old master showing he\u2019s still got it, and I\u2019ve not a clue how he does this without making contact with the Ferrari, but he does! What a man! Lap 44/57 Verstappen leads by 10.058s and I can\u2019t think of a race in which we\u2019ve seen so little of the leader. Lap 43/57 Tahe virtual safety car has gone while Gasly, who pitted when it was around, passes Albon and moves into ninth. He\u2019ll fancy getting on the board here; Alonso is within 0.979s of Sainz, with Hamilton a further 1,790s behind him. Lap 42/57 So Perez is now even further clear in second, 14.965s ahead of Sainz, who\u2019s promoted to third, and Alonso is 2.451s behind him, so that final podium-place is up for grab. Poor old Sharl, though, who\u2019s had it ripped from his clammy grasp. Lap 41/57 We see the Ferrari easing to halt at the side, and might that be another battery issue? Remember they changed it earlier today\u2026 Lap 40/57 Alonso is pulling away a little, his lead over Hamilton now above 0.7s \u2026 and Norris, a lap behind Hamilton nearly runs into the back of him, but manages to avoid a collision. Lap 39/57 Verstappen\u2019s lead is down to a pathetic 11.759s following his stop, with Perez a further 12.629s in front of Leclerc. The venerable Alonso leads Hamilton by 06.s or so. Lap 38/57 Alonso sets the fastest lap-time and goes at Hamilton again, first from the outside before ducking on the inside, he gets DRS, goes by, pulls away, and that is a brilliant move! Alonso is back in fifth, and does Hamilton have the power to respond? Lap 37/57 Verstappen comes in, so Perez gets a little go at leading. The gaps between the top four are significant, but Hamilton is 2.363s behind Sainz in fifth, with Alonso 0.596s behind him in sixth \u2026 and he attacks down the straight, nails Hamilton on the inside \u2026 but Hamilton comes back at him, taking a really good line, and hangs onto fifth \u2026 for now\u2026. Lap 36/57 We\u2019ve barely heard a peep out of Verstappen, so dominant is he. His lead is now 37.679, though he\u2019s a stop behind, and this is a terrifyingly competent piece of smack-resting. Lap 35/57 Perez pits, then Alonso, and Leclerc duly moves into third, then Alonso comes out behind Hamilton. This could be a decent little tussle. Lap 34/57 Ocon learns he\u2019s another 15s penalty to serve, but sadly the director cuts after his team inform him. I daresay he used some  . Veratappen leads by 14.363s. Lap 33/57 Fernando Alonso is having a nice day out, 15.650s in front of Sainz and well ahead of Hamilton. The top four looks set, but there should be a decent fight for the crumbs. Lap 32/57 Russell comes in then is out in time to right with Sroll for seventh; Stroll undercuts him and gets by! Russell just didn\u2019t have the grip he needed as his tyres were new, and that\u2019s very well played by Aston Martin. Lap 31/57 Hamilton pits and returns behind Russell in seventh, but his teammate will soon go in to restore the previous order. Verstappen Perez Leclerc Sainz Alonso Russell Hamilton Stroll Zhou Lap 30/57 The earliest anyone\u2019s ever won the driver championship is with four races to spare. I wonder if Verstappen might attack that record; I think he might. Lap 29/57 Lando Nozza pits again, comes out in 19th, behind Hulkenberg, and he\u2019s another who\u2019s had better days. At the front, Verstappen leads by 13.565s, with Perez now 4.546s in front of Leclerc; perhaps Ferrari will try an extra stop, or a different tyre to try for P2, P1 already gone barring mechanical failure. Lap 28/57 Ahahahahaha! Coming into the pit lane to serve his 10s penalty, Ocon speeds! That\u2019s being investigated, and I daresay there are some tempers about. Lap 27/57 Hamilton\u2019s been managing his tyres but his team tell him to up the pace now, while Perez, now in second, is told to look after his. Red Bull, meanhile, have never taken P1 and P2 in a season-opener. Well, that looks almost a cert this time around. Lap 26/57 Perez gets DRS up the hill, barges by Leclerc on the inside and into second; Leclerc comes back at him, but he\u2019s out of range now, so Red Bull secure first and second. Lap 25/57 Verstappen powers away. He looks untouchable. Verstappen Leclerc Perez Sainz Hamilton Alonso Russell Stroll Bottas Albon Tsunoda Lap 24/57 Yup, Piastri is out of the race \u2026 and we see Perez just 0.484 behind Leclerc with DRS, then learn that Ocon hsa been given a 10-second penalty for not serving his five-second penalty properly. You\u2019ve got to laugh. Lap 23/57 I hope Carlos Sainz\u2019s nickname is Little. Ansd yes, that was kind of an excuse to recommend Little Simz\u2019s album No Thank You \u2013 one of the best if not the best of 2022. Lap 22/57 Alonso has been pestering his team to find out if action has been taken against the cad who he reckons impeded him on the first lap; his team, of course, don\u2019t want to tell him it\u2019s Stroll, his teammate. Surely someone at Aston Martin has a sense of humour? Verstappen leads Leclerc by 11.175s. Perez is next, then Sainz, then Hamilton. Lap 21/57 Verstappen is absolutely killing this. Lap 20/57 Ocon, it seems, didn\u2019t serve his time-penalty properly, so he\u2019s in more trouble. Menatime, William Preston emails: \u201cHas there ever not been an opening race where one car and driver gets a proper stomp on from the outset, and we all sigh and say \u2018Well, might as well call it now\u2019? It\u2019s an F1 tradition, as are the thrilling heroics the mechanics and engineers put in between the times to make it much tighter by the redemptive third act. It\u2019s a beautiful story each year, and looking forward to this one.\u201d Yup, agree. We think we know and maybe we do, but we don\u2019t watch the last five minutes of a Poirot because ultimately it\u2019s not about who killed Lady Merryweather-Smythe, it\u2019s about why and how. Lap 19/57 In comms, they note that Verstappen and Red Bull are like Schumacher and Ferrari were, with enough pace to pretty much do whatever they want. Verstappen and Perez are on softs, but Albon is the only other member of the top 10 not using hards. Lap 18/57 Norris pits again and I\u2019m not sure how long he\u2019ll be staying out there \u2013 his team will want to protect their car. Save when pitting, the top five has been the top five since the first corner. Lap 17/57 Perez pits, Verstappewn resumes the lead, and the game is 10.189s. Lap 16/57 \u201cJust as well I haven\u2019t subscribed to Sky!\u201d sighs Anne Williams. \u201cFrom the sounds of things Verstappen is going to cruise through all the races barring engine failure or someone taking him out!\u201d It does look like that, but we also know something always happens. Meanwhile, Alonso has Bottas under pressure, takes him out easily, and he\u2019s sixth. Lap 16/57 Piastri seems to have a gearbox issue \u2013 electrical -related \u2013 and Perez now leads with Verstappen pitting. Perez Verstappen Leclerc Sainz Hamilton Bottas Alonso Russell Stroll Albon Tsunoda Gasly Lap 15/57 Verstappen pits and exchanges softs for softs, while we learn that Ocon, who has damaged his front wing, has been hit with a five-second penalty for being in the wrong position at the start. Lap 14/57 Russell pits, then we see Ocon\u2019s plate dangling off; he\u2019s in 14th. Hamilton, meanwhile, is out of the pits in seventh, while Piastri, the next big hope, is in the pit with some kind of issue and he looks to be done for today; what a disaster this weekend has been for him. Verstappen still leads, by plenty. Lap 13/57 Hamilton pits \u2013 Russell wanted to a couple of laps ago \u2013 and here comes Alonso, looking to nail him down the straight! Alonso nudges ahead, Russell finds a great line to come back at him \u2026 then Alonso finds yet more gas and breezes by! Lap 12/57 Alonso\u2019s Aston is waaaaaay faster than Russell\u2019s Merc which, like Hamilton\u2019s has a problem with its rear tyres; it feels like a matter of time before sixth and seventh swap. Albon and Hulkenberg pit; Verstappen leads by 8.481s. Lap 11/57 Alonso is hunting Russell now, but without much success, while Norris pits and has an engine issue. He\u2019ll be gutted and that might be the end Lap 10/57 Alonso, though, is 0.9ish behind Russell and has DRS; Russell thinks he might be being held up by Hamilton. Otherwise, Gasly is first to pit and presumably will prompt others to do the same. He comes back, after an untidy change, last. Lap 9/57 Verstappen leads by 6.266s and there\u2019s not much movement anywhere now; who will blink first and change tyres? Lap 8/57 Verstappen is in such great nick it\u2019s disgusting. Lap 7/57 George Russell holds the fastest lap so far, but he still trails Hamilton by the best part of a second. Verstappen Leclerc Perez Sainz Jr Hamilton Russell Alonso Stroll Bottas Ocon Albon Norris Lap 6/57 Magnussen beings up the rear, suffering for his choice of hards \u2013 but we\u2019ll how that unfolds. Versatappen leads by 4.783s. Lap 5/57 Stroll nips by Bottas and now sits eighth; Verstappen\u2019s lead is 4.021s and he\u2019s lapping nearly a second faster than the lads behind him. He\u2019s just got to stay on the circuit to win.

Be aggressive, but not overly. Be compact, be wild in moments, be brave - these kinds of things. It is a derby but sometimes we know the emotions can get the best out of us or the other way round. It is all about how good we defend and how good we attack. A mix of experience and the football part which Harvey Elliott brings - he played really well against Wolves, setting a new record for counter-pressing situations. Pre-match thoughts from the readers:Joe Pearson: \u201cWhat worries me today is Rashford barrelling down the left against Alexander-Arnold. I just hope Rashford doesn\u2019t channel his inner Vinicius Junior this afternoon.\u201d Mike MacKenzie: \u201cI\u2019m worried with both Fabinho & Henderson in midfield. I\u2019d have picked Bajcetic instead of either of them. But I\u2019m just a dolt in Canada.\u201d Jeff Sax: \u201cThe best chance for a long time for MU to win.\u201d This is the era of hot takes in Our League, and who could deny Graeme Souness his right to make this piping-hot prediction? Roy Keane and Gary Neville could be smirking on the other side of their faces come full-time. \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f \u201cI fully expect them [Liverpool] to turn up today, it\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve been this confident about a Liverpool win against [Manchester] United.\u201d  Graeme Souness is backing a Liverpool victory today. \ud83d\udcaa  pic.twitter.com/O8zm9apXBaIan Copestake has been in touch: \u201cThe nature of much that has been written about this game seems to have turned it into a symbol rather than a physical event. Them overtaking us, the old ways dying, can a new spring occur? Klopp even calls it a derby, which it isn\u2019t. But it is \u2018like\u2019 a derby and so may as well be called one.\u201d Will Unwin on Casemiro, a player who must be seen as the signing of the season, unless you prefer the shock and awe of Erling Haaland. \u201cWhen you go to recruitment in the summer, we were looking for players with character, with personality,\u201d Ten Hag says. \u201cIt was not only about signing players. A lot of players in the world have great skills from a technical approach, or they can run really fast, but we were looking for players who have character, who have personality, who have leadership, take responsibility, who are resilient. That is the type of players I was looking for after I analysed the squad.\u201d Casemiro\u2019s arrival and impact reminds of when Edgar Davids played half a season for Barcelona in 2004, and suddenly they became the world\u2019s best team. Or, for older readers, Bobby Collins joining Leeds in the early 1960s and making them into the Leeds United the world came to know. He may not burn for long, but he has burned bright. Not, of course, that he needs to be pensioned off in any sense. Jonathan Liew examined a rivalry of two clubs more alike than their fans might like to admit. Though perhaps they all realise that by now. The investment in Ten Hag\u2019s side has been not simply in terms of money but time and patience. The backroom structure has slowly been filled out after years of neglect. There is now an established playing style, something United have arguably not enjoyed since Louis van Gaal. Naturally, there are no long-term guarantees. But United are at least trying to construct a coherent identity, to build a functioning organisation, to be \u2013 in other words \u2013 a little more like Liverpool. For Manchester United, that\u2019s the same team that started and won last week\u2019s Carabao Cup final, and for Liverpool there\u2019s three changes from the midweek defeat of Wolves. Jordan Henderson, Cody Gakpo and Andrew Robertson are those to come in. No Stefan Bajcetic in midfield, with Harvey Elliott\u2019s energy instead trusted over the young Spaniard\u2019s poise. Such has been Bajectic\u2019s impact that\u2019s a surprise selection. Bobby Firmino, for the off this summer, is on the bench. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson, Elliott, Fabinho, Henderson, Salah, Nunez, Gakpo . Subs: Kelleher, Milner, Firmino, Jones, Carvalho, Matip, Tsimikas, Bajcetic, Jota Manchester United: De Gea, Dalot, Varane, Martinez, Shaw, Casemiro, Fred, Fernandes, Weghorst, Rashford, Antony.  Subs: Heaton, Maguire, Malacia, Sabitzer, Sancho, Wan Bissaka, Elanga, McTominay, Garnacho Jonathan Wilson\u2019s Observer column today focuses on Jurgen Klopp. The danger for a managerial great is to hang on because there is such a faith in his abilities: he was the messiah once and he can be again. But cults of personality are dangerous: blind allegiance to a manager obscures the other factors that make a successful club. And managers themselves are not constant. The tendency is to self-parody, in late career to ask not what the most effective solution might be but to attempt the most characteristic. When last they met, Erik ten Hag got his first ever win as Manchester United manager.And he did so after dropping Cristiano Ronaldo, a decision that would forebear the binning of the former legend turned millstone by Ten Hag. He\u2019s been speaking about that this weekend. I do consider big decisions like that, definitely. I have to look at the impact they make, not only in the short term but also for the longer term. You always have to think strategically as a manager and face the consequences. I am aware of it but that is my job and my responsibility. I had reasons to choose that team against Liverpool. They were obvious. And I knew the reaction if it had been a negative outcome, which is always possible in football. But I am not worrying. I sleep well also in those nights. I have to take the decisions in respect of the club and the team. I have to stand by those decisions. From J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s programme notes for this game.As things stand, this season has been a better one for them [United] but there is still time and opportunity to improve things for ourselves. The last four games we have played in the Premier League have shown that we definitely have the appetite to do this and I could not be happier with the way the players have accepted the challenge ahead of them. When we lost to Wolves a month ago, we received a lot of criticism and much of it was deserved. We are always our own biggest critics but the best thing is that we always have the chance to put things right for ourselves. That this has started to happen in the games that I have mentioned is a real positive but it does not happen without everyone being ready to get through a tough period together. This is a message that I have used repeatedly because it is one of the most important I know. Together we have a chance. Together we can deal with problems and come up with solutions. Together we can find a way to be better. And the great thing about this club is that it is built on togetherness, especially at times that are not so good. Important announcement before this game. This nonsense has to stop. It\u2019s time everyone grew up.  Ten Hag said: \u201cThe rivalry between Manchester United and  Liverpool is one of the greatest in world football. We all love the passion of the fans when our teams meet, but there are lines that should not be crossed. \u201cIt is unacceptable to use the loss of life \u2013 in relation to any tragedy \u2013 to score points, and it is time for it to stop. Those responsible tarnish not only the reputation of our clubs but also, importantly, the reputation of themselves, the fans, and our great cities. On behalf of myself, our players, and our staff, we ask our fans to focus on supporting the team on Sunday, and representing our club in the right way.\u201d Klopp added: \u201cOne of the main reasons why the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United is so special is that it is so intense and no one should ever want to change this. But at the same time when the rivalry becomes too intense it can go to places that are not good for anyone and we do not need this. Here we go, here we go, here we go\u2026.this is it. Let\u2019s be honest here, this fixture between the trademarked two biggest clubs in England, and certainly the most successful, can often be an absolute dog. Form doesn\u2019t so much go out the window as forget itself as the tranqs kick in. At least there is plenty at stake here, with Liverpool\u2019s eyes focused on the top four, and thankful to Wolves for yesterday\u2019s win over Tottenham. United\u2019s chance of a title is slim, especially if the top two keep winning but keeping Liverpool down in the Europa League/Conference League would meet the approval of fans, and also affect the summer transfer plans of a club who would really like someone like Declan Rice or Jude Bellingham to add quality to their midfield. It was only a few weeks ago that Cody Gakpo chose Anfield over Old Trafford, a decision that has not looked the best choice so far. Still, should Liverpool win this, then they can begin to look upwards and to a future brighter than what has been such a poor season for them. For United, a quadruple is on, though their eternal rivals are this season showing the problems of fighting on so many fronts. Kick-off is 4.30pm.

She controls the ball on her chest and cuts across a volley that is comfortably saved by Berger, falling to her left. That would have been some impact from Pelova, who has been on the field about a minute. 58 min: Arsenal substitution Victoria Pelova replaces Katie McCabe, who was once again in the thick of it. She was booked, went down twice with head injuries \u2013 but, most significantly, won the penalty from which Kim Little put Arsenal 2-1 in front. 57 min Chelsea are starting to threaten again. Kerr makes another good run, this time down the right wing, and picks out the unmarked James 20 yards from goal. She whips a first-time shot that curls a few yards over the bar. Zinsberger had it covered. 55 min Kerr makes a terrific run behind the Arsenal defence, onto Perisset\u2019s long, angled pass, but Rafaelle recovers superbly to push the ball behind. The corner is cleared. 51 min Leupolz is booked for a studs-first follow through onto McCabe\u2019s ankle. 50 min A big moment of fortune for Berger, whose lazy pass is blocked by the stretching Blackstenius but goes straight back to the keeper. 49 min McCabe goes down again holding her face after a hefty collision with Eriksson. She\u2019s fine. 48 min James, so quiet in the first half, runs at the defence, rolling her studs over the ball, and finds Reiten on the left. She curls a first-time cross towards the penalty spot, where Cuthbert gets in front of the Arsenal defenders but screws an acrobatic volley wide of goal. A half chance at best. 47 min Foord shoots a few yards wide from distance. It took a deflection off Bright, in fact, but a goalkick has been given. 46 min Arsenal begin the second half. Chelsea have made a second substitution: Melanie Leupolz for Niamh Charles. That means Eve Perisset will return to right wing-back. \u201cAs a properly stung Arsenal fan, 3-1 isn\u2019t good enough for me to feel safe against Chelsea and Kerr,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cWould 4-1? Maybe, but they\u2019re officially the horror movie villain who isn\u2019t dead for sure until the credits end.\u201d Half-time readingPulsating stuff at Selhurst Park. It looked like the same old story when Sam Kerr headed Chelsea ahead in the second minute, but Arsenal responded irresistibly. Stina Blackstenius equalised after a quickly taken free-kick, a symbol of Arsenal\u2019s tempo in the first half, and then Kim Little scored emphatically from the spot after Katie McCabe tricked Sophie Ingle into a loose challenge. For a while it looked like Arsenal could win the game before half-time. Emma Hayes changed both tactics and personnel, which helped Chelsea to restore order \u2013 until Niamh Charles scored an unfortunate own goal with the last touch of the half. In fact, it came off Niamh Charles. She was off balance as she tried to head clear, under pressure from Rafaelle, and ended up diverting the ball past both Berger and Ingle on the line. It looked like Ingle had a decent opportunity to clear, but she reacted slowly and the ball went straight over head. There was also an important half block from Blackstenius, who ensured \u2013 some would say illegally, others would say legally \u2013 that Berger couldn\u2019t get a clear run at the ball. Catley, on the right, curled a pacy inswinging corner towards the near post. Berger came through the crowd \u2013 and I think she ended up punching it into her own net! Oh my word! 45+2 min Cuthbert\u2019s free-kick is spilled by Zinsberger, under pressure from Bright, but the ball lands safely and the flag had gone up anyway. 45+1 min Four minutes of added time. It\u2019s actually Arsenal who will be glad to hear the whistle now, because Chelsea are stirring. 45 min McCabe, who has switched to the left for the time being, teases a deep cross that just evades the leaping Foord. 43 min Chelsea have been better since the switch to a back three, and everything points to a humdinger of a second half. 42 min Looks like a 3-4-1-2 for Chelsea. Eve Perisset has moved into midfield alongside Sophie Ingle, with Cuthbert playing in a more advanced role. 41 min \u2026 but Reiten\u2019s free-kick hits the wall. 40 min Cuthbert wins the ball high up the field and is fouled 22 yards from goal by Walti. This is a chance for Chelsea\u2026 39 min: Chelsea substitution Kadeisha Buchanan replaces Jelena Cankovic, which definitely means Chelsea will play with a back three. 39 min: Half chance for Kerr! Reiten beats Maritz thrillingly, knocking the ball one side and running round the other. Then she curls a terrific cross to the far post, where Kerr heads wide under pressure from Catley. 38 min Emma Hayes is about to make a tactical substitution. No surprise, even at this early stage, because Chelsea are being  . 37 min Maanum\u2019s shot on the turn from 15 yards goes well wide. Just before that, the ball hit Bright right on the edge of the area, and Arsenal wanted a handball. The referee wasn\u2019t interested. 37 min Foord\u2019s dangerous cross is headed away bravely by Eriksson. Cuthbert lumps the ball somewhere, anywhere, just to get a few seconds of respite. 36 min It looks like Emma Hayes has switched to a 3-4-2-1, with Reiten at left wing-back and Charles switching to the right, although it\u2019s hard to be certain because they are being moved all over the place. 35 min: Blackstenius has a goal disallowed for offside! It was beautifully taken \u2013 one touch to control and another to flick it past Berger \u2013 but she was definitely offside. 32 min Berger is fine. McCabe is on her feet, though she looks a bit groggy\u2026 until she is booked, at which point she gives the referee a mouthful. McCabe kicked Berger in the chest and, though she was going for the ball, you can understand why a yellow card was dhown. 30 min: Great goalkeeping from Berger! Maanum\u2019s clever header releases McCabe, who is just beaten to the bouncing ball on the edge of the area by Berger. They both go down, with McCabe holding her head, but it looked like a really good \u2013 and brave \u2013 bit of goalkeeping. Replays confirm as much, but they are both still down. McCabe is receiving very careful treatment to her neck. 29 min A sloppy pass from Blackstenius goes straight to Kerr, 45 yards from goal. She\u2019s all on her own against Rafaelle and Williamson, so she makes a beeline for the Arsenal area, but Rafaelle makes a really good tackle. 28 min I haven\u2019t seen Arsenal play this well all season, maybe in years. The tempo has been relentless. 27 min: Chance for Arsenal! Catley hooks a spectaculative over-the-shoulder cross towards the near post, where Blackstenius gerts in front of Eriksson and forces a header towards the near post. Berger gets down really smartly to her right to push it away. 26 min Berger is okay to continue, and the match has resumed. 25 min That was a brilliant penalty from Little. Play hasn\u2019t restarted yet, because the Chelsea keeper Ann-Katrin Berger is receiving treatment to her right leg. It doesn\u2019t look great actually.

Now this match is over, I would heartily recommend joining John Brewin for Liverpool v Manchester United. Surely, it will not be as good as Forest v  Everton. Just your eight bookings there. Forest improved once Gibbs-White was moved centrally.  Everton really need Calvert-Lewin back soon because they are reliant on height in the box due to the wingers they have available. It was a hectic encounter at the City Ground and a draw is certainly fair enough. It keeps Forest four points clear of the relegation zone going into two tough games. 90+4 mins: Davies loses the ball to Dennis, so makes up for his error by pulling back the striker. Another yellow is shown on a busy day for the referee. 90+2 mins:  Everton win a corner on the right. Tarkowski and Keane go up for it. McNeil swings it in, Keane heads it back but the referee blows up for something or other. 90 mins: Five minutes added on. 88 mins: Gueye and Lodi have a scrap, the Brazilian wins a free-kick and takes it quickly. For some reason, Gueye then pulls his opponent down anyway. Being feisty for the sake of it. Iwobi marauds down the pitch and almost makes it through on Navas but Yates is there to clear up. Maupay and Davies are ready to come on. Maupay almost joined Forest in the summer until they were talked out of it and they will be pleased they avoided it. Iwobi and Gray off. 86 mins: It is a probably not a great sign for those on the  Everton bench that Dyche has not seen fit to bring any of them on. They are playing OK but you would think they had someone that could add impetus at this late stage. Johnson gets Godfrey\u2019s elbow in the back of his head but it is not a foul. 84 mins:  Everton are upset that Dennis\u2019 foul on Gueye is missed and become more annoyed when Doucoure is penalised for taking down Ayew. Johnson gets down the right wing and pings a cross into the box, which creates some pinball until Tarkowski pumps clear. 82 mins: Forest break; Ayew makes it to the edge of the box and takes aim for the bottom corner. He fires his shot across Pickford who gets a strong wrist to the ball and he sees it go away from red shirts. 80 mins: Forest break but Johnson pulls back McNeil to take him out of the game. A good spot form the referee, although he should bring out a yellow for that. 79 mins: Forest have made their three subs. Is it time  Everton think of some changes to freshen things up, otherwise they could be at risk here. Felipe is the latest to go into the book for taking out Gray from behind. That is a bad challenge. A poor pass from Doucoure is intercepted inside the  Everton half. Johnson collects the ball, lays it to Yates who plays to straight back to the forward, allowing him to find the top corner from 16 yards. 76 mins: Lodi sends in a \u2018long\u2019 throw from the left but  Everton clear easily and break but it ends because there is no one in the box to cross to. 74 mins: Dennis seems to be operating on the left with Ayew down the middle with Johnson. Down the other end, Iwobi darts past Worrall, who just about holds him up. Eventually,  Everton win a corner. Gray swings it in from the left and Worrall clears. 72 mins: Shelvey has dropped deeper alongside Yates, allowing Gibbs-White to play in his preferred position behind the strikers. He makes a dynamic run and looks to find Johnson with a pass but Godfrey reads the danger and clears. 70 mins: Here come the subs for Forest. Yates, Dennis and Ayew are on. Colback, Freuler and Wood are off. It will be interesting to see how they set up. 67 mins: Felipe plays another bad backpass, which Worrall belatedly leaves for Navas, who reacts just in time to clear. Down the other end, Aurier swings in another cross that is easy for Pickford to claim. 65 mins: Who will Cooper turn to first? Lingard, Surridge, Ayew, Dennis? 63 mins: Coleman bundles over Freuler in the corner and there is another split second of pushing. Lordy, this is becoming difficult to keep track of. Can\u2019t everyone play nice? 61 mins: Gibbs-White, another on a booking, lunges in on Onana and gives away a free-kick, causing some damage to his opponent at the same time. The referee feels the award of the free-kick is punishment enough and so do I. Onana gets up gingerly. \u201cThis is the sort of game you have to feel sorry for the ref,\u201d  says Samuel Campbell. \u201cIt looks like he has lost control of it a bit but the players acting like little children is making it nearly impossible for him.\u201d 59 mins: Johnson goes past Godfrey, who has a tug at his shirt but the winger does not go down. With Godfrey on a booking, the referee would have had a decision to make. Dyche might need to make a change at left-back soon. Down the other end, Felipe sends a dreadful looping backpass in the vague direction of Navas, who reads the danger and runs out to clear. 57 mins: Now Tarkowski is booked for an elite-level lunge on the touchline on Lodi in an attempt to stop a counter. It is not that bad and a yellow is the right decision, despite the anger in the stands. 55 mins: Forest are having a good spell. A Shelvey shot is deflected wide. Gibbs-White takes the corner short to Johnson, who drives for the byline but his cross is well overhit. There is another melee. Lodi and Gray are booked for their involvement in the latest contretemps. \u201cTemper, Temper boys,\u201d  says Mary Waltz. \u201cWho gets the first Red Card? This is Drunken Pub league stuff and someone is going to lose it.\u201d I\u2019d be surprised if this ends 11 v 11. 53 mins: The aforementioned free-kick is cleared. Eric Peterson emails: \u201cWatching that first half was wonderful for a Toffee, but it also made me revert back to my frustration about the  Everton that was so offensively inept under Frank Lampard. TV in the USA lauded, most properly, Doucoure and Onana for pushing up from midfield and fueling the attack today. Where was this for the first half of the season, when it was so clear how bare the cupboard was at Everton once Richarlison was sold and not replaced? And if anyone should have recognized the value of giving the midfielders a mandate to join and even force the attack, why not the guy who made his legendary name as a player doing just that?\u201d 51 mins: It\u2019s getting feisty. Tackles fly in from players on both sides. McNeil goes head-to-head with Gibbs-White and they both get a booking. More importantly, Forest get a free-kick in a dangerous position. 49 mins: Wood is very much a man aiming to come deep to flick the ball on. He is a very different striker from Awoniyi. He seems a strange replacement in this specific system. 47 mins:  Everton enjoy all the possession in the first minute of so to keep the City Ground quiet. A dangerous cross is whipped in from the left but Forest clear. The ball makes it out to the left where Gray and Aurier battle for it. Forest get the throw, causing some friction between the two players that needs calming. Here we go again! Forest have a few issues to sort out, mainly how to get Gibbs-White into the game more. Gibbs-White is their most dangerous player but Shelvey seems to be playing in the space he often occupies and he is more keen to play in behind sooner. Hmmmmm \u2026. Want some half time reading? The read me on Liverpool v United while I decide on having a cake or biscuit. The visitors are edging proceedings in what has been a pulsating 45 minutes. As Dyche said before the match, it is all about putting together a full performance in a match. That is the real test for  Everton. 45+1 mins:  Everton break on Forest. Doucoure gets down the left and pulls it back for Gray to shoot from 12 yards but Gibbs-White blocks what is a tame effort. 45 mins: Two minutes added on. 44 mins: Could Dyche bring on Vinagre for his first appearance in the league since August? I am not sure Godfrey can play 90 minutes at left-back. 42 mins: Godfrey, who has had a tough time, goes into the book for taking down Johnson on the right touchline. An impressively needless foul. Johnson is down receiving treatment. 41 mins: \u201cDyche has the boys playing with maximum effort,\u201d  says Mary Waltz. \u201cThe game is chaos, a constant formless mess, which favors  Everton. But I am keeping expectations suppressed. Since Sparks was mentioned earlier I think \u201cEdith Piaf Said it Better\u201d would be appropriate.\u201d 40 mins: McNeil, who is wandering all over the pitch, pops on the right wing. He receives a pass and cuts in onto his favoured left foot to let fly from 25 yards but Navas is able to tip it over. 39 mins: The City Ground is enduring a rare spell of quietness in the stands because  Everton are once again on top. Their midfielders and forwards are playing with great fluidity, making it hard for Forest to pick them up. 37 mins: Whenever  Everton get into crossing positions, Onana and Doucoure get into the box to provide some height. They are both a threat but if Forest win the first header, it leaves a big gap in midfield. 35 mins: Forest are looking to regroup after the sucker punch of the second goal. They keep looking long for Wood which Tarkowski and Keane will not mind at all. \u201cWell this is unexpected,\u201d  says Joe Pearson. \u201cBoth teams average less than a goal per game, and here they\u2019ve already scored three! Maybe they just need to play each other all the time.\u201d 33 mins: Forest have Tottenham away and then Newcastle at home in their next two games, making it very important that they get something here. It could be one of the great relegation battles this season. 31 mins: This is all a bit relentless, isn\u2019t it?  Everton have scored twice to put them level of goals this season with Wolves and Forest at the bottom of the \u2018for\u2019 pile. Pickford lumps a free-kick forward, Tarkowski and Keane get their heads to the ball and it eventually goes into the six-yard box where Doucoure gets the wrong side of Freuler to nod home. 29 mins: No one seems particularly happy with John Brooks at the moment. He doe not give a foul on Gibbs-White but gives a free-kick to  Everton immediately after. Some red shirts surround the referee and he aims to calm tensions.

As this Six Nations has worn on, there have been numerous suggestions that it is a problem, a terrible look to have such a competitive pool, with three of the world\u2019s top-five ranked teams. The only sane response is: why? Why is it a bad thing to have a pool so tightly contested? To have a pool in which predicting the two qualifiers is not straightforward? To lament the draw is to hark back to the days when all quarter-final qualifiers were predictable, when you could put the house on who would make the last eight. There was a similar argument in 2015 but that tournament will be remembered for the incredible drama of a pool from which Australia and Wales advanced  and England did not. A place in the quarter-finals is not the birthright of the more established countries \u2013 the old Five and Tri Nations sides. It is not the preserve of the institution, those with more seats on executive committees. God knows it is hard enough for the so-called tier-two nations to upset the old order, even if  World Rugby has mercifully moved to address the glaring disparity over in-tournament rest periods between established and developing countries. Without the kind of jeopardy in Pool B, there is the danger we are left going through the motions until the knockout stages. Granted, France against New Zealand will be a spectacle not to be missed \u2013 just as  the All Blacks\u2019 early encounter with South Africa was in 2019 \u2013 but in this elongated tournament there are more than five weeks between that opening night and the first quarter-final. As thrilling as the late stages of last year\u2019s Rugby League World Cup were, France 2023 really does not want a repeat of the tedium that preceded it in the pool stages. The stick with which World Rugby is often beaten is that the draw took place just over a year after the last tournament, with seedings based on the world rankings at the start of 2020 \u2013 in other words, straight after Japan 2019. It must be remembered, however, that World Rugby\u2019s hands were tied by the pandemic, with the 2020 fixture list obliterated and some teams not playing at all that year. Rankings at the end of that year were initially supposed to apply. As World Rugby also points out, there is no perfect time to make the draw \u2013 doing so early allows for things such as ticketing and marketing campaigns \u2013 and the flux among the world\u2019s top 10 of late is unprecedented. Again, that is no bad thing, either. You could argue that a draw so early in a World Cup cycle allows teams to focus less on results in the middle of it, but that Eddie Jones is no longer England head coach perfectly illustrates the pitfalls of such an approach. It should also be remembered that South Africa were ranked seventh when the draw for the 2019 World Cup was made, in the second band of seeds, and it did them no harm. Sign up to  The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed after newsletter promotion Admittedly, the situation is aggravated by the fact that New Zealand, France and an eye-catching young Italy side are in the pool on the same side of the draw. This gives the tournament a lopsided look but that only adds intrigue to the other half, where it is not inconceivable that Japan and Fiji end up meeting each other for a place in the semi-finals. It is in that half, where the established sides look less strong \u2013 with Steve Borthwick, Warren Gatland and Jones all racing the clock with England, Wales and Australia, respectively \u2013 that the potential for upsets is ripe. And just as was the case in football\u2019s World Cup, with Morocco reaching the semi-finals, all good tournaments need a sustained run from an unlikely source. Go back four years and, apart from that high-octane clash between New Zealand and South Africa, it was Japan and their swashbuckling run to the knockout stages that illuminated the first half of the tournament. Take that away and we would have been left with referees chastising themselves for not clamping down hard enough on high tackles in the opening weeks of the tournament and the impact of the devastating typhoon. Looking to this year\u2019s tournament, history does at least bode well, because at France 2007, Fiji reached the knockout stages and Argentina the semi-finals for the first time. In the professional era, Japan, four years ago, are the only other side to reach the knockout stages beyond the more established eight nations. That paltry record is a blight on the tournament and if having one pool of death provides a better opportunity for more unlikely quarter-finalists then surely that is something to be celebrated.

The 24-year-old all-rounder made his first one-day international appearance in Mirpur last week to complete a full set of international debuts within the space of six months, but injury now looks likely to apply the brakes to his ascent. With Jacks out, the series won and spin reinforcement required \u2013 England bowled 46.2 overs of it across the first two games of the series, through Jacks, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid \u2013 Rehan Ahmed is likely to make his international white-ball debut in the final ODI on Monday. The 18-year-old was ruled out of the first game through illness but has fully recovered, impressing in recent training sessions. \u201cHe is the real deal,\u201d Mark Wood said on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s got youthful enthusiasm and excitement and it\u2019s as if he\u2019s playing a club game. He just wants to bowl and whack it. He has a nature about him which is just lovely to see. It\u2019s quite infectious and I am really looking forward to seeing how he goes. When he played his Test match, it was like it was not a big deal, and I think he will be exactly the same in whatever format it is. I know the pressure might be on a little bit more in one-dayers where people try to whack you, but I think he will deal with it fine.\u201d Before the opening ODI last Wednesday Jacks had not played a 50-over game of any kind since 2019, but his record in Twenty20 cricket \u2013 and his ability to bowl useful off-spin \u2013 has forced him into England\u2019s white-ball reckoning. In 102 career innings in the format he averages 29.8 with a fearsome strike rate of 157.9, memorably scoring a 48-ball 108 for Oval Invincibles in the Hundred last year. He left the field midway through Bangladesh\u2019s innings in the second game of the series on Friday after feeling tightness in his muscle, and will now fly home to begin his recovery, missing the three T20s that follow the concluding ODI on Monday. Jacks has four weeks before he is due to make another debut, with Royal Challengers Bangalore\u2019s first game of what will be his first Indian Premier League season scheduled for 2 April. RCB bought him for 3.2 crore (\u00a3250,000) in the December auction. The injury is not thought to be serious enough to jeopardise his participation in the IPL. Meanwhile Wood has said England\u2019s success in Bangladesh, where they have become the first touring side in nearly seven years to win an ODI series, shows that they are capable of winning in any conditions \u2013 including at the World Cup in India later this year. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got such a good, talented group. When I\u2019ve finished I can say that I got to play with the likes of Jos Buttler and other people like that \u2013 these are some of the best players that England\u2019s ever produced,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that we can\u2019t turn up here and win, why not? Why can\u2019t we? We\u2019ve got an unbelievable team. Why can\u2019t we win in these conditions? I don\u2019t think as a team we should fear anybody. We can beat anybody in any conditions.

Harlequins like to give their supporters a great day out at their annual Big Game and, sure enough, Marcus Smith produced his full repertoire of tricks to leave England\u2019s head coach, Steve Borthwick, in no doubt about his ability or relish for the big occasion. Having been omitted from England\u2019s training camp in Brighton this week, the onus was on Smith to prove a timely point and the fly-half did so spectacularly with a man of the match performance. The ball remains in Borthwick\u2019s court ahead of his team\u2019s Six Nations game against France at this same venue next weekend but Smith could not have done much more in terms of underlining his talent and state of readiness. A below-par  Exeter did not always help themselves but, with Borthwick and England\u2019s current attack coach, Nick Evans, in attendance, Smith was at the heart of a fizzing home performance, directly setting up two tries and nailing all but one of his place kicks. \u201cHe was sharp so he\u2019s going to make selection really difficult for Steve and the England coaches,\u201d said Quins\u2019 head coach, Tabai Matson. \u201cHe did what Steve asked him to do. Will he be an option this week? Only Steve knows that but he\u2019s put his best foot forward and shown there\u2019s another way. Tonight we saw a masterclass in finding space.\u201d At times everything felt almost pre-ordained, particularly in the first quarter. One lovely Smith dummy outfoxed the onrushing Chiefs chasers and, for good measure, there was also an effective tackle on the high-stepping Christ Tshiunza. Then, with little on just outside the home 22, the fly-half spotted some space over the top and a deft little chip gave Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen the chance to put a gleeful Cadan Murley over at the other end. It was the perfect example of what Smith can conjure, given the freedom and licence to do so. If England want a fly-half who gives the roulette wheel a calculated spin, there is none better in the land. If they want someone to play the percentages and prioritise territory and a relentless kicking game, there are more pragmatic options available. What you see in club rugby, clearly, is not always what you get at Test level. That said, it would be the most colossal waste of talent if Smith does end up being relegated to the role of tackle bag holder and water carrier in the short and medium term. Given Owen Farrell\u2019s recent travails off the tee, Smith\u2019s touchline conversion of Joe Marchant\u2019s second try, set up by a neat Danny Care grubber kick, delivered perhaps the heftiest nudge of all. If you were to be hyper-critical you could point to one missed conversion and a mis-hit drop goal but, even taking into account the costliness of Harvey Skinner being sent to the sin-bin and Exeter\u2019s lack of penetration, his energising effect was almost tangible. It was one of those days when almost everything stuck for Quins, not least the outrageous back-door offload from Care in the right corner which allowed a grateful Sam Riley to register his side\u2019s third try. On replay it seemed the ball might have flown forwards but the referee, Matt Carley, chose not to be a killjoy. Sign up to  The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed after newsletter promotion There was also more than a hint of a forward pass in the buildup to Quins\u2019 bonus point try but, once again, play carried on and Smith unselfishly gave Marchant the chance to finish off another thrilling 60-metre team score. At 26-0 down at half-time there was no coming back for the visitors and, despite a consolation for Jack Innard, the only remaining question was exactly how many points Quins would ultimately rack up. Their back row delivered almost as resounding a performance as Faithless had done prior to the game and the skipper, Stephan Lewies, deserved to get on the scoresheet. It is also a result that propels Quins right back in to the playoff picture, although they must now head to Bristol next weekend to face the suddenly resurgent Bears. Whether they will be able to call on Smith for that fixture, after this cane-twirling exhibition, must surely be doubtful. Can England really afford to do without him?

The 35-year-old Jones took Gane to the mat just a little more into the round, and won with a guillotine choke at 2:04 in UFC 285. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working for this for a long time.

Jones, however, wanted to prove he could be just as successful at the highest weight, and that for sure would erase any remaining doubts about his place in history. The swiftness of this victory cemented that legacy. There were questions whether so much time off would affect Jones\u2019 effectiveness, and he spent time at his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to prepare for this night. His last fight was 8 February 2020, a unanimous decision over Dominick Reyes. \u201cI had to show up and get him down to the ground,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI been wresting since I was 12 years.

Jones said he next wants Stipe Miocic, who is the second-ranked contender and who Jones called the greatest heavyweight ever. France\u2019s Ciryl Gane, 32, was the top-ranked heavyweight contender.

Grasso, however, got Shevchenko to the mat late in the fourth when the now former champ went for a back kick. Then Grasso, 29, put Shevchenko in a position where she was forced to tap out.

Suella Braverman, the home secretary, will introduce an amendment to the public order bill, after peers had voted through a change to stop those reporting on protests from being subject to police action. It comes after a backlash against the arrests of LBC reporter Charlotte Lynch, the press photographer Tom Bowles, the film-maker Rich Felgate and another photographer, Ben Cawthra, by Hertfordshire police while covering climate protests on the M25. The police later apologised to the journalists and an  investigation, commissioned by the Hertfordshire force, concluded \u201cpolice powers were not used appropriately\u201d in making the arrests, but stopped short of admitting they were unlawful. Following legal action by one of the journalists, the force admitted its actions were unlawful.

However, peers raised concerns that this was based on senior officers having ordered the arrests, rather than officers exercising their own judgment \u2013 and argued that this was not specifically covered in legislation.

Hancock conspired with  Dominic Cummings, the chief adviser to then prime minister Boris Johnson, to remove Stevens before the Covid-19 pandemic was declared in March 2020.

However, the NHS chief \u2013 a former Labour councillor who advised Tony Blair on health in the early 2000s \u2013 had irritated a succession of Conservative ministers since taking over the post in 2014 with his outspoken criticisms on their handling of the health service, especially its funding.

The health secretary replied: \u201cIt\u2019s OK \u2013 he needs to know he is massively fucking up.\u201d Stevens also incurred Hancock\u2019s ire in May 2020 by not warning him of plans to announce that dental surgeries would be able to reopen to patients the month after. Johnson told Hancock that the NHS boss \u201cgrovelled\u201d to him because ministers had hoped to make the announcement themselves. Early December 2020 brought another clash. Stevens was angered by media reports that \u201cmillions\u201d of people would receive a Covid jab before Christmas. In a message to a WhatsApp group that included Hancock and senior officials, Stevens said: \u201cThere is no version of reality whereby \u2018several million people will receive the vaccine before Christmas\u2019 so whoever briefed that might want to urgently undertake some course correction before that inevitably becomes clear.\u201d When Stevens announced in April 2021 that  he was quitting after seven years in the post and left that summer, Hancock praised him for being \u201ca steadfast and sage leader for our National Health Service, and that had been especially true during this most testing period in NHS history\u201d.

Jeremy Hunt ordered the workforce review amid concerns the economy is being held back by shortages of workers that have emerged since the pandemic and  Brexit.

Department for Education officials had submitted a plan for a free entitlement of 30 hours a week for working parents of children aged nine months to three years, after being asked to work up options by the Treasury.

Last week\u2019s public inquiry concluded that  MI5 had missed a significant chance to take action that may have prevented the 2017 bombing that killed 22 people. Parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC) is likely to be handed the task of overseeing the agency\u2019s response to the key recommendations. However, tensions have been simmering between the ISC, which oversees the UK intelligence community, and the security services, with MPs complaining about the speed and \u201cprovision of evidence\u201d it has asked for. Jonathan Hall, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said: \u201cThere has been a bit of concern expressed by parliament that they\u2019re not getting the cooperation they need. It begs the question whether that relationship will need to be improved if the ISC is going to deliver oversight of the recommendations. \u201cWe need to have responsive, open- handed institutions willing to say: \u2018Here it is\u2019 and not try and second-guess what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d Publication of the Manchester Arena inquiry\u2019s  third and final report on Thursday prompted the director general of MI5 to say he \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d it did not act on information about the bomber, adding that he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d the agency had failed to stop the attack. Hundreds were injured when Salman Abedi detonated his homemade device in the foyer of  Manchester Arena as crowds left an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. Abedi, who had links to Islamic State and al-Qaida terrorists, had appeared on the radar of MI5 and counterterrorism police at least 20 times before he blew himself up outside the concert. In its  latest annual report, published in December, the ISC \u2013 one of parliament\u2019s most important committees \u2013 identified several areas of concern over its relationship with the intelligence agencies. It stated: \u201cThis committee has been severely hampered over the past year by the failure of the UK intelligence community to provide responses to the committee in accordance with the deadlines set. \u201cThis is a serious issue, as it prevents the committee from effectively performing its statutory oversight role. If the ISC\u2019s oversight is frustrated then the ISC cannot provide any assurance to the public or parliament that the intelligence agencies are acting appropriately.\u201d After publication of the inquiry\u2019s report last week, MI5 claimed that since the arena attack it had made more than 100 improvements. \u201cBut we are determined to do more. As the [inquiry] chair now considers his recommendations, we will engage fully,\u201d said Ken McCallum, the director general of MI5. Sign up to  A digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion In its annual report, the ISC added that since it had raised the issue of information sharing with the heads of the UK\u2019s intelligence agencies, MPs had been \u201creassured\u201d that they had \u201crecognised the need to address this situation\u201d. The final report by the inquiry, led by Sir John Saunders, delivered more damning verdicts into the security services than previous ones. That difference is largely explained by the fact that a number of frontline MI5 officers were interviewed in secret, their accounts of vital intelligence surrounding Abedi differing from MI5\u2019s \u201ccorporate position\u201d, which was viewed by Saunders as more of a \u201cretrospective justification for the actions taken or not taken\u201d. Some experts believe the verdict underlines the need for oversight bodies such as the ISC to be able to speak freely with all those involved, including frontline officers, in order to develop a full and true account of the circumstances surrounding terror attacks. Hall is among those who believe the findings may mean junior intelligence officials are automatically required to give evidence in the event of future terror incidents. \u201cIt\u2019s whether this sets a precedent for future post-attack inquests.

There are no details as yet on how this would get around the UK\u2019s obligations under the European convention on human rights. Sunak and the home secretary, Suella Braverman, are heading to France on Friday for a summit with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, where the small boats are expected to be discussed. Over the weekend, Sunak told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cSince becoming prime minister, I have made the issue of illegal migration one of my top five priorities, pledging to stop the boats once and for all. \u201cIllegal migration is not fair on British taxpayers, it is not fair on those who come here legally and it is not right that criminal gangs should be allowed to continue their immoral trade. I am determined to deliver on my promise to stop the boats. So make no mistake, if you come here illegally, you will not to be able to stay.\u201d Braverman told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cEnough is enough. The British people want this solved. They are sick of tough talk and inadequate action. We must stop the boats. That\u2019s why myself and the prime minister have been working flat out to bring forward necessary and effective laws which will tackle this problem, once and for all.\u201d Labour responded to the new plans by criticising Braverman\u2019s efforts so far. A party source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a joke for the home secretary to say enough is enough when it is her department and her government\u2019s failure that has led to skyrocketing Channel crossings, a soaring asylum backlog and total collapse in asylum decisions while criminal gangs put lives at risk. Sign up to  Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion \u201cShe\u2019s right though: the public have had enough, enough of this incompetent Conservative government and their failing ideas.\u201d The Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, was challenged on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday about the lack of alternative safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to come to the UK, aside from those applying from Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong, from Syria or other war-torn areas of the world. He said he thought \u201cmore routes\u201d would be made available. The latest Home Office figures show 2,950 people have crossed the Channel on small boats already this year. Meanwhile, a group of 12 trade unions released a joint letter  accusing the government of complicity in the violent attacks on hotels housing refugees. \u201cThe government is complicit in these attacks,\u201d said the group, which included the FBU and GMB unions. \u201cThe Rwanda policy does not make sense as a means of stopping small boat crossings \u2013 and it is failing on its own terms \u2013 but it fits with a long-running campaign of rhetoric and demonisation.\u201d ", "category": "politics", "source": "theguardian", "summary": "\nRishi Sunak and Suella Braverman are launching a new law this week to try to make asylum claims inadmissible from those who travel to the UK on small boats, with the prime minister insisting that \"if you come here illegally, you will not to be able to stay.\""}, {"title": "New Brexit trading rules could take more than two years to bed in fully", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/mar/05/northern-ireland-new-brexit-trade-rules-could-take-more-than-two-years-to-bed-in-fully", "text": "The new Brexit trading arrangements in Rishi Sunak\u2019s revised  Northern Ireland protocol could take more than two years to be fully implemented, government sources have confirmed. Businesses in Northern Ireland say they expect a mass educational campaign to be launched across the country by HMRC and other government departments to help them put the deal  announced in Windsor last Monday into operation if it is approved by parliament. But with legislation required to bring the Windsor framework into force, the first of the new measures could take months to become operational. A government source said if the new deal was ratified it would be \u201cintentionally giving industry time to prepare. Essentially, it is a phased introduction over this year and in 2024.\u201d However, the introduction of updated labelling for products travelling across the Irish Sea via the new customs \u201cgreen lane\u201d will be staggered, with the last stage being implemented as late as July 2025. Businesses are still trying to work out what the deal means for them. \u201cIt is important to emphasise this is a framework but there\u2019s a lot of operational detail to work through,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, the head of public affairs at the Northern  Ireland chamber of commerce. \u201cThere is also a quite significant political, practical and legal work to get through as part of the process. For example, the timeline for labelling is until July 2025 underlining that this is very much a process over time.\u201d Labelling products as \u201cnot for the EU\u201d will be one of the most visible changes to result from  Brexit in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Under the new arrangements producers of fresh meats, such as sausages, and dairy products will have to start labelling goods for sale in Northern Ireland from this October. The government has promised swift reimbursement to cover the cost. From October next year, labelling requirements will be extended to include all other dairy products, such as UHT milk and butter, across the UK. The final phase of labelling will enter into force in July 2025 and apply to fish, fruit and vegetables and composite products such as ready meals. Both the Northern Ireland chamber of commerce and Manufacturing NI say they are confident that businesses will be able to work with government to bring the new rules into operation. \u201cAs businesses we had to shout from the sidelines in the past, sometimes we had to kick down the doors to get heard but now we know we are going to be invited into the room,\u201d said Stephen Kelly, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, one of a group of business representatives who met Sunak last week.

Kelly said some of the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d such as the tariff reimbursement schemes  could be up and running by early summer. This is a repayment scheme for any businesses that are not certain of the end destination of their product but who bring materials in through the red lane and pay an EU tariff on a component. If that product ends up being sold and remaining in Northern Ireland they can claim back the tariff. \u201cWe expect HMRC will have to implement changes to some systems and a campaign to educate traders, but there are relatively simple things they could get started with in the early summer.\u201d Farmers will also be looking for a swift enactment of the Windsor clauses that reverse bans on the importation from Great Britain  of seed potatoes and 11 native British trees, along with a relaxation of rules regarding secondhand farm machinery.

Of 125 hospital trusts in England analysed, only three (2.4%) hit the standard of treating 85% of patients within 62 days after an urgent referral in 2022. Some trusts have not hit the standard for at least eight years. More than 66,000 patients were forced to wait more than two months for their first treatment last year after a referral, the figures reveal. One leading cancer charity said this weekend the cancer care system was not fit for purpose, with \u201clives left hanging in the balance\u201d. The failure of the vast majority of hospital trusts in England to hit the target has been revealed after a House of Commons  public accounts committee report, published last week, reported that waiting times were at their worst recorded level. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dems health spokesperson, said the figures showed that even before the pandemic struck, the number of hospital trusts meeting targets was falling rapidly. \u201cNow the situation is so bad that barely any hospitals are able to provide patients with the treatment they need on time. Ministers have consistently failed to plan ahead or provide adequate funding, while taking patients and NHS staff for granted. There is a shocking gap in cancer care from one area to another,\u201d she said. The analysis by the House of Commons library, commissioned by the Lib Dems, reveals that at some trusts more than half of patients waited longer than two months before cancer treatment after an urgent GP referral last year, including those at the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust (61%), Leeds Teaching  Hospitals NHS trust (59%) and North Middlesex University Hospital NHS trust (59%). At the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS trust, 3,060 patients were treated for cancer after an urgent GP referral in 2022. Out of those, 1,953 (64%) had to wait longer than 62 days for first treatment. The only three trusts to hit the performance standard were Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS trust, Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS trust and Queen Victoria Hospital NHS trust in West Sussex. The NHS  Cancer Plan 2000 first set out targets for the times patients should wait before receiving treatment. The target has been consistently missed since 2013-14 and there was a significant further deterioration during the pandemic. Most recent NHS England figures reveal that from October to December, just 61% of patients were treated within two months of an urgent referral for suspected cancer, with 17,465 patients waiting longer than the treatment standard. Many of the delays after a referral involve waits for tests and a conclusive diagnosis. Minesh Patel, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u201cWith cancer waiting times in England officially the worst on record and a chronic shortage of cancer professionals, it\u2019s clear that the current cancer care system simply isn\u2019t fit for purpose. Despite the efforts of hardworking NHS staff, too many people are facing agonising waits for cancer treatment, with their lives left hanging in the balance.\u201d Dr Ian Walker, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cWith growing numbers of people in the UK expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the years ahead, the task ahead is huge. We urge the government to publish a long-term workforce plan that commits to growing staff numbers, and use the upcoming spring budget to make sure it is backed with funding.\u201d Hospital trusts say they are working hard to reduce backlogs. A spokesperson for University Hospitals Birmingham said that an \u201cimmense amount of work\u201d had been undertaken to improve capacity and that the number of patients waiting longer than two months for confirmed diagnosis or to start treatment had more than halved, from 1,600 in September to 518 in February. Dr Hamish McLure, interim chief medical officer at Leeds teaching hospitals, said: \u201cIn the last year we reduced the number of patients on a 62-day cancer waiting list by 60%. We have done this by increasing our diagnostic and treatment capacity.\u201d The Department of  Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing high levels of urgent cancer referrals \u2013 with over 10,000 per working day in December 2022 \u2013 and over 92% of patients started treatment within a month of a decision to treat.

The first big intervention by trade unions on the increasingly politicised issue follows comments on Friday by the Conservative party\u2019s deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, who said he  had sympathy with people protesting outside hotels. His remarks came days after the home secretary, Suella Braverman, said hotels providing refuge to asylum seekers were causing  \u201cunderstandable tensions\u201d, and protesters targeting them were not \u201cracist or bigoted\u201d. A wave of protests, many organised by far-right anti-immigrant groups, has targeted hotels in recent weeks, with a number culminating in violent clashes with police. One far-right group involved is Patriotic Alternative (PA), founded in 2019 by Mark Collett, an admirer of Adolf Hitler, who once suggested   as one of three books people should read. PA, Britain\u2019s fastest-growing far-right group, delivered hundreds of leaflets attacking migrants to homes in Merseyside days before a  riot outside a hotel in Knowsley housing asylum seekers.

The unions, which also include the University and College Union, which has more than 120,000 members ,the Fire Brigades Union, Aslef, the RMT, Equity and the Musicians\u2019 Union, also sent their solidarity to  Care4Calais, the refugee charity caught up in the Knowsley attack. \u201cWe call on workers and trade union members to show their solidarity and to mobilise against the far right,\u201d added the joint statement. A number of the protests outside hotels have been met with counter demonstrations, many organised by anti-fascist groups. Hard-right protesters visited hotels housing asylum seekers 253 times last year, twice as many visits as recorded in 2021. The most prolific of the self-proclaimed \u201cmigrant hunters\u201d last year was Amanda Smith, a member of the hard-right English Constitution party, who is said to have visited migrant accommodation 124 times.

Chelsea v Borussia Dortmund (20:00 GMT, 0-1 first leg) Chelsea NewsGraham Potter has been in a difficult situation, game after game, with his team's results at rock bottom. When Chelsea lose, he wants to explain the defeat without making excuses. It leaves him torn between mentioning external factors like injuries, while also repeating that they're no excuse for the dreadful results. So it was interesting to see the situation reversed on Saturday. After his team managed to win just their second game of 2023 with an ugly 1-0 victory against Leeds, he was hardly going to be gloating - and indeed instead he chose to note that his side needed a lot more attacking fluency and coherence. But it's not just that, Graham - the defending and the pressing is shambolic too. That's why the excuses he likes to point to just don't ring true. We can all agree that the injuries, the new signings and the lack of pre-season have made things far more difficult for him, but a good coach should only need days or maybe weeks to get a semblance of some shape in his team. In fact, the very best coaches build systems that new players can pick up quickly, because injuries and new signings are part of the game.

The Guardian can reveal the government agreed to allow the former Chelsea Football Club director Eugene Tenenbaum to sell Park Hill, in Weybridge\u2019s exclusive St George\u2019s Hill estate, under a licence issued by sanctions officials on 12 May 2022. Tenenbaum was added to the  UK sanctions list on 14 April last year. The sale, to the chief executive of a Singapore hotels group, completed on 17 May 2022, according to Land Registry records. Park Hill, an eight-bedroom mansion set in 1 hectare (2.6 acres) of grounds , was jointly owned by Tenenbaum and his former wife, a British citizen and who is not under UK sanctions. Lawyers for Tenenbaum told the Guardian the sale of the property was completed in accordance with the law and with the consent of the UK government. They said \u201chis proceeds of the sale were frozen on completion of the transaction in accordance with the sanctions regime\u201d. The transaction raises questions about the UK government\u2019s approach to enforcing sanctions. Liz Truss, who was then foreign secretary, said last year that UK financial restrictions would \u201ctighten the ratchet on Putin\u2019s war machine and target the circle of people closest to the Kremlin\u201d. Allies in the US and EU have also imposed similar sanctions. Tenenbaum was Abramovich\u2019s right-hand man as the billionaire oligarch built his empire, serving as the head of corporate finance at his oil company Sibneft, a director of Chelsea, and a board member at his mining group Evraz. Tenenbaum, a Canadian citizen born in 1964 in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union, helped him float the company on the London Stock Exchange where its shares were  traded until shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A loan agreement seen by the Guardian suggests Tenenbaum and his then wife bought Park Hill in 2007 using a \u00a312m loan from an offshore company connected to Abramovich. The agreement states the borrower cannot sell the property without agreement in writing from the lender, and that the loan was due for repayment in 2027. A document from September 2020, which named the couple, suggests the interest-bearing loan was still outstanding at that date, and that the amount borrowed had increased to \u00a317m. Lawyers for Tenenbaum indicated the couple have divorced.  They confirmed a licence for the transaction was granted by Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). \u201cAs fully anticipated by Mr Tenenbaum,\u201d they said, \u201chis proceeds of the sale were frozen on completion of the transaction in accordance with the sanctions regime and the terms of the OFSI licence. They remain frozen to this date. We are instructed that the proceeds from the sale of the property are not, and will never be, for the benefit of Roman Abramovich.\u201d It is understood Tenenbaum\u2019s former wife does not owe money to any sanctioned individual or any company connected to them, that she has not and will not send money to any sanctioned individual, and that she has fully abided by the UK sanctions regime. The property has dedicated staff accommodation, a games room and an indoor swimming pool complex with a steam room, a gym and changing rooms. It is located in the gated estate of St George\u2019s Hill, a popular choice for wealthy Russians looking to set up home near London, where the perimeter is guarded by private security contractors. The UK designated Abramovich for sanctions on 10 March 2022, two weeks after the invasion began, adding Tenenbaum to the list a month later. In a press release, the government  described Tenenbaum as a \u201ckey oligarch\u201d, citing his links to Abramovich, and said freezes on his property and money would \u201cprevent these assets from being repatriated to Russia and used to fund Putin\u2019s war machine\u201d. Tenenbaum and his then wife had owned Park Hill in their own names, according to Land Registry records, and bought it on 17 July 2007 for \u00a310.5m. A loan agreement dated 29 June 2007, seen by the Guardian, names them both as the borrowers of \u00a312m from Ovington Worldwide Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), in order to \u201cpurchase and make any additions\u201d to Park Hill. Company paperwork appears to show Abramovich was the beneficiary of a trust that controlled Ovington. In September 2020 Ovington transferred the loan to Sonora Capital Investments Ltd, another BVI company, which was also owned by a trust of which Abramovich was a beneficiary. Abramovich did not respond to a request for comment.

The mansion was sold to Anand Nadathur, the son of the Infosys co-founder Nadathur Raghavan and chief executive of the hotels company Next Story Group, and his wife. A lawyer for Anand said contracts for the sale of the property were exchanged on 6 April 2022, before Tenenbaum was added to the UK sanctions list. After the sanctions were imposed and the licence was granted, their legal advice was that they were bound to continue with the purchase, and the buyers acted entirely properly, the lawyer said. Large transactions of any kind with individuals under sanctions are illegal unless the parties have obtained consent from OFSI. Permission for smaller transactions to allow for basic needs may also be allowed in some instances. Ben Cowdock, the investigations lead at Transparency International UK, an anti-corruption campaign group, said: \u201cAt a time when the UK government was publicly taking a firmer stance on allies of the Kremlin and their assets here, it appears a sanctioned oligarch was quietly given permission to sell his mansion. This raises serious questions over why this sale was allowed, how the proceeds were distributed and the lack of transparency surrounding the licensing process. \u201cTo avoid the perception that Britain is a soft touch when it comes to enforcing sanctions, the UK government should be more open about how licences are given and where the funds from these sales end up.\u201d The government has previously faced criticism for granting licences to other oligarchs under sanctions. It allowed the  Russian mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin a licence to pursue legal action against a journalist, and it granted the London-based oligarch Petr Aven living expenses of \u00a360,000 a month, a level consistent with a luxury lifestyle. OFSI also granted Abramovich a licence for the sale of  Chelsea Football Club, with an official saying allowing the deal to go ahead avoided an impact on the club, its employees and the \u201cwider football community\u201d. The \u00a34.25bn proceeds were held in a UK bank account and frozen. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe do not comment on specific licence applications. However, our sanctions system is robust and strictly enforced with financial penalties and criminal prosecutions for those who break the rules. \u201cWhere someone is subject to an asset freeze it\u2019s prohibited to make funds available to them through sales of assets, either directly or indirectly.\u201d ", "category": "business", "source": "theguardian", "summary": "\n\nThe UK government granted a license to former Chelsea FC director Eugene Tenenbaum to sell his Surrey mansion for \u00a316m a month after he was designated for UK sanctions and froze all his assets, with the proceeds of the sale frozen in accordance with the sanctions regime."}, {"title": "Bank of England policymaker warns of \u2018greedflation\u2019 risk to consumers", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/07/bank-of-england-policymaker-warns-of-greedflation-risk-to-consumers", "text": "A senior Bank of England policymaker has expressed concern that UK companies could be exploiting the cost of living crisis to push through  inflation-busting price increases \u2013 a phenomenon widely known as \u201cgreedflation\u201d. Catherine Mann, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee, said she was concerned about the ability of firms to take advantage of consumer willingness to tolerate higher prices. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mann said the pricing power of companies meant bringing down the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate to its 2% target would require interest rates to rise further from their current 4% level. The Bank of England has been closely monitoring pay levels for signs of a developing wage-price spiral but Mann\u2019s comments reflect growing anxiety about the risk posed by corporate greedflation \u2013 where businesses more than pass on higher costs to customers \u2013 although she did not use that specific term. The European Central Bank expressed  similar concerns last week. The headline rate of inflation has come down slightly from a peak of 11.1% to 10.1%,  according to the latest official figures, but Mann said she was more focused on core inflation \u2013 which strips out items such as food and fuel. The rate setter said she was particularly \u201cconcerned about the extent to which there is strong pricing power among firms and acceptance of those price rises by a lot of consumers\u201d. Even in the face of the cost of living crisis, Mann added, there were \u201cstill a lot of people out there who are willing to pay higher prices, and firms are willing to set their prices high\u201d. Mann said she felt vindicated after calling for interest rates to be raised faster in 2022, arguing that a \u201cfront-loaded\u201d policy would have been more effective in dampening inflation expectations. Despite raising interest rates at each of its last 10 meetings, Mann said more needed to be done to prevent high inflation being embedded. The weak pound, she added, was a \u201cvery important ingredient\u201d pushing up inflation, as it raised the cost of imports of goods, and energy. The UK, Mann pointed out, was a \u201csmall open economy\u201d that imported a lot of products, and the pound would be vulnerable if US and eurozone interest rates continued to rise.

It really is that bad.\u201d Rather than tax cuts or a bonfire of regulation in  next week\u2019s budget, he says, Rishi Sunak\u2019s government ought to wake up and recognise that this isn\u2019t the way to run a 21st-century economy. Rather than a \u201c1980s playbook\u201d, it should be working for closer ties between business and government, better relations with unions, and a clear industrial strategy. He admits our conversation is \u201ca bit of a whingeing session\u201d, but there is a purpose to it. Since leaving Siemens after 33 years, Maier has started  vocL, an app-based business mentoring and speaking platform. Siemens, John Lewis, Sainsbury\u2019s, Timpsons, Arup and Brompton Bikes are all on board, keen to foster the next generation of bosses willing to speak out on big political issues. \u201cWe think the future will be a different political landscape,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to predict the outcome of a general election, but whoever assembles a government will draw the conclusion that they need a better relationship with business. We want to equip the business leaders of the future with the tools, knowledge and, frankly, moral courage to engage in a positive political and private sector relationship.\u201d For years, he says, company chiefs have largely ducked the public sphere, preferring to stay silent on the big issues. Now Maier wants them to speak up. He uses Liz Truss\u2019s \u201cdreadful\u201d  mini-budget to highlight the importance of doing so. \u201cNone of what was in that mini-budget was being called for by business. How did business stand by and allow it to happen? We need to be at the top table, helping create policies that are good for business and society.\u201d Maier is adept at practising what he preaches. He talks 19 to the dozen, is full of stories and, as a regular panellist on BBC   clearly isn\u2019t afraid of a robust debate \u2013  not least when it comes to Brexit, of which he is an outspoken critic. Business support for Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201c Windsor framework\u201d Northern Ireland deal is strong, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a return to a sensible conversation \u2026 and provides some confidence that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d Despite this, Maier thinks a wider campaign to rejoin the EU is still years away: \u201cWe\u2019re miles from that, honestly. And I don\u2019t believe that is where business is at all.\u201d European ties are second nature for Maier, a proud Anglo-Austrian. His home is full of signs of his dual heritage: Austrian wine in the fridge, walls adorned with a painting of the  W\u00f6rthersee (where he has a second home in the Alps), plus framed prints of Manchester landmarks. Born in 1964 in Germany to Austrian parents, he moved to Leeds aged 10 after his mother remarried an Englishman from County Durham. Starting school as a \u201cforeigner\u201d who couldn\u2019t speak English, and realising he was gay, made for a tough start. \u201cIt was awful, to be honest. I had to learn quickly.\u201d He remembers after-school fights between boys from his comprehensive \u2013 Allerton Grange in the suburb of Moortown \u2013 and a local rival, surreptitiously helped by a PE teacher who taught boxing. \u201cIt\u2019s now sort of the Didsbury of Leeds,\u201d he says of the area where his mother still lives, meaning it\u2019s fairly affluent. \u201cBut when I came to the UK it certainly wasn\u2019t.\u201d His degree in engineering at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University) was sponsored by Siemens, and he did an industrial placement there before starting as graduate engineer in 1986 at its factory in Congleton, Cheshire. As Maier was growing up, northern England\u2019s industrial backbone was crumbling. \u201cIt\u2019s why I\u2019m so passionate about these things. I want to be part of the generation that improved that,\u201d he says. And there is a lot to be learned from Germany\u2019s approach: \u201cThe scale, the gravitas, the long-termism, the strategic intent. And the business partnership with government.\u201d When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, he and a friend jumped in his battered Ford Granada and drove from Congleton to witness the moment. \u201cI just wanted to see it,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be a part of history. And it was fascinating.\u201d Maier recalls that during   (the turn), as the reunification period is known, Siemens loaned some top employees to the German government to help in piecing the country back together. The UK could learn lessons on close partnership between government and industry, but will it? \u201cThere\u2019s the odd minister, you know, with the right intent,\u201d he says. But the big danger is that without a consistent plan, regional divisions will remain, and Britain will fall behind as other countries steal a march in building the green economy of the future. Although he won\u2019t be drawn on how he votes, he says Labour clearly has a better relationship with business. His big ask is that any government develops and sticks to a proper industrial strategy: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call it. Let\u2019s just have something sustainable.

The comments by the chief executive of the Bank\u2019s regulatory arm, Sam Woods, come a day after his boss and the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, said that reforms to so-called Solvency II regulations would  increase the possibility of life insurance firms failing by 20% in a given year. Firms like Aviva and Legal & General claim the reforms will release hundreds of billions of pounds for big investments like infrastructure projects, by reducing the amount of capital they have to hold to prove they can pay policyholders in the long term. The Treasury and BoE have disagreed over the potential risks of Solvency II reforms, which the Conservative government hopes will accelerate the levelling up agenda across the UK. Woods told MPs on Tuesday that the government was offering the Bank \u201cadditional powers\u201d to oversee the insurance sector, including additional stress testing \u2013 which measures how firms would fare during a severe market downturn \u2013 and requiring senior managers to personally vouch for the fact that the firm is holding enough capital against risks on their balance sheets. However, Woods said it did not make up for increased risks the planned reforms pose. \u201cThe government has committed \u2026 to give us some additional powers to help us manage risks in the insurance sector,\u201d Woods told the Treasury select committee, adding: \u201cWhat I would say though, is that we do not think we either should, or can, use those to achieve the same effect, as we were looking for through a reform of the fundamentals.\u201d However, Woods told the committee he did not feel strongly enough about the risks to suggest that MPs vote against Solvency II changes, and was at no point considering resigning from his post over the issue. MPs also pushed Woods over plans to reform the UK ring-fencing regime, which was introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and forces banks to separate, and protect, customer deposits from their investment banking activities. Some lenders argue that the rules are no longer necessary, because other regulations are in place to ensure the banks themselves could afford to go bust in an orderly way, without relying on taxpayer bailouts that would ultimately protect customers and the wider economy. Woods said that while he welcomed some reforms, scrapping ringfencing entirely could put taxpayer money at risk. The committee also asked whether the Bank was concerned over the potential impact of the climate crisis on the mortgage market, including cases where lenders may refuse to offer home loans in areas at a greater risk of flooding due to more extreme weather events. Woods speculated that the government could be forced to intervene  in a similar way to the cladding crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a live example of this quite recently with cladding \u2026 where a lot of people are kind of trapped. \u201cIf the effect of climate change or other things meant that you had parts of the country, that as a matter of wider government policy, we want to be inhabited but which could not get funding for from banks, or could not get insured, then I think that would be a question for the government to look into,\u201d he said.

The new body, which does not have an official name yet, would bring oversight of China\u2019s financial system under direct control of the State Council, the top government body. There are also reports that the president, Xi Jinping, who will in all likelihood be granted a third presidential term on Friday, will revive the Central Financial Work Commission, an organisation that would supervise the financial system on behalf of the Chinese Communist party, although this has yet to be announced publicly. The new financial watchdog, which will be voted on at this week\u2019s  annual parliamentary session, the National People\u2019s Congress, will centralise control of China\u2019s $60tn (\u00a350.6tn) financial sector. It is part of a series of reforms that will \u201cstrengthen the centralised and unified leadership\u201d of the party, according to the proposal. In the speech from the outgoing premier on Sunday, Li Keqiang promised that Beijing would focus on stability and mitigating economic risk this year, particularly in the property sector. Last year China\u2019s  property sector shrank by 5% after government crackdowns on speculation and lending led to a cashflow crunch that caused developers to stall construction on millions of housing units. The zero-Covid policy, which was abandoned in December, also caused economic chaos as factories and construction sites were closed and workers were unable to leave their homes. In February, Xi warned of three \u201csystemic risks\u201d to China\u2019s economy: the embattled real estate sector, financial regulation and local government debt. The new financial watchdog will help to streamline party oversight of all of those sectors. Part of the property crisis last year was caused by property developers issuing bonds that, via local governments, were packaged into asset-backed securities that were sold to financial institutions and investors. Those investors often had no idea that they were buying bonds linked to the property market. \u201cSo the risk spreads from the real estate sector, which is not financial, into the financial sector,\u201d said Iris Pang, the chief economist for greater China at ING, a bank. The new, broader financial regulator will be able to \u201cdetect this kind of risk earlier than in the case of 2022\u201d. Pang also said that a new, more integrated regulator would be better suited to handling future financial developments, such as cryptocurrencies. Among the other reforms outlined by the proposal are the creation of a new centralised data bureau, a reorganisation of the science and technology ministry and the slashing of jobs in central government departments by 5%.

According to a draft of the EU\u2019s Net-Zero Industry Act, which is due to be unveiled next week, 40% of green tech needed to meet the bloc\u2019s climate and energy targets should be made in the EU by 2030. The 40% target, which could change before the draft is finalised, is part of Europe\u2019s answer to the US  Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers $369bn (\u00a3311bn) of subsidies to green-tech manufacturers, as well as China\u2019s long-running policy of lavish state support for the sector. Some EU leaders have  sharply criticised the IRA, arguing that it discriminates against European companies selling to the US and provides inducements for them to shut up shop in Europe and move production to America. The European Commission president,  Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to raise the issue when she meets Joe Biden at the White House in Washington on Friday. Since the coronavirus pandemic exposed Europe\u2019s shortfalls in medical equipment, there has also been momentum behind a push led by the French president,  Emmanuel Macron, for a \u201csovereign\u201d Europe with a stronger manufacturing base, less dependent on foreign imports. The EU is currently a net importer of net-zero energy technologies, according to the draft regulation seen by the Guardian. It notes that a third of electric cars and batteries and nearly all solar photovoltaic modules and fuel cells come from outside the EU, mostly from China. Even in areas where EU industry remains strong, such as wind turbines and heat pumps, \u201cour trade balance is deteriorating and EU producers face headwinds of rising energy and input costs\u201d, it continues. EU leaders will discuss the plans at a Brussels summit later this month (23-24 March), as part of a broader push to speed up the green transition but also to boost the mining and extraction of critical raw materials in Europe, such as rare earths, aluminium and copper \u2013 ores and metals used to make electric batteries and wind turbines. To achieve the 40% target by the end of the decade, the EU executive wants to speed up planning permission for plants manufacturing net-zero technologies. Currently, it can take between two and seven years to build a new factory, depending on the technology and member state. The draft proposes that large plants producing net-zero technologies that are deemed \u201cstrategic\u201d should be able to get a permit within one year. Smaller strategic plants should be granted permission within nine months. Net-zero factories will be considered strategic if they help the EU reduce a heavy dependency on imports, lead to a significant expansion in capacity or create many high-skilled jobs.

Ninety-one-year-old Marjorie Roper* discovered that her pension and benefits payments had been stopped and her direct debits cancelled after a Barclays agent recorded that she had died and closed her account. The nightmare began in November when Roper informed Barclays that her husband had died. She asked for his name to be removed from their joint account and replaced with that of her daughter, Mary*, who has third-party access to her account. Instead, she was marked as deceased and the account was closed. Her pension and benefit payments were returned to the Department for Work and Pensions and her direct debits were stopped. She discovered the mistake when she returned from a family Christmas to find her phone line and energy supply had been cut off and a sheaf of letters from companies and the council demanding payment. Roper made two trips to her nearest Barclays branch and was told on both occasions by staff that she was recorded as dead. The bank refused to discuss the case with her daughter because her third-party authority had been revoked when the account was closed. \u201cThe bank has blocked my mother\u2019s income and it cut off her only means of contacting the outside world,\u201d Mary Roper said. \u201cFor the last month she\u2019s been buying food with the \u00a3250 she had left in cash and is terrified she\u2019ll run out.

Her phone line and energy supply had already been restored after Roper called her providers to explain. A Barclays spokesperson said: \u201cWe apologise unreservedly for the distress and inconvenience this has caused to our loyal customer.

The coal plants began operating in 1966 but were due to close last September.  However, operators have kept them open for an extra six months at the request of the government, amid fears of possible power shortages. Temperatures are expected to drop to -15C (5F) in some parts of the UK on Tuesday evening, with snow sweeping parts of the country.  The cold snap is expected to last for the next few days, with weather warnings in place across the UK.

Two further contingency coal fired units, at Drax power station in Yorkshire, were ordered to get ready for use as well earlier in the day but have now been stood down.  The extra generating capacity was lined up this week due to concerns that the margin between supply and demand was becoming too narrow.  National Grid blames the cold weather, a shortage of wind and solar power generation, and a lack of electricity available through interconnectors from France due to strike action in the country.  However, plans to use the so-called demand flexibility service - which pays people to use less electricity - have been set aside.  Although the cold weather is expected to continue tomorrow, the grid is expected to be under less strain because more electricity will be available through international undersea cables. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and produces almost twice the emissions of natural gas. Gas and wind power have been gradually replacing coal in powering the UK's energy supply over recent years.  But this has been delayed by the government following concerns over the disruption to Russian gas supplies to Europe after Russia invasion of Ukraine.

Initially, people had until 5 April to make voluntary adjustments for gaps between 2006 and 2016, but the cut off has been extended to the end of July. The original deadline had led to blocked phone lines. In general, people need 35 years of qualifying contributions to get the full state pension. Some people may have spaces in their National Insurance record, for example if they have lived abroad or taken time off for caring responsibilities. Top-ups have been permitted, as part of the transition to the  flat-rate state pension which was introduced in 2016. But blocked phone lines to HM Revenue and Customs left some worried they would miss the April deadline, and led to the latest extension which the government said was to ensure nobody would miss out. \"HMRC [HM Revenue and Customs] and DWP [the Department for Work and Pensions] have experienced a recent surge in customer contact,\" said financial secretary to the Treasury, Victoria Atkins. \"We've listened to concerned members of the public and have acted. We recognise how important state pensions are for retired individuals, which is why we are giving people more time to fill any gaps in their national insurance record to help bolster their entitlement.\" Pensions experts say that extra contributions may not suit every individual in these circumstances, so it is important to check whether it is worthwhile for their finances.

US stocks fell and the dollar rose following the remarks, which comes just a few weeks before the bank is due to make another rates announcement. Many analysts had been expecting another 0.25 percentage point increase. But the comments suggest the bank could move more aggressively.  Over the last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate to more than 4.5% - the highest rate since 2007 - responding to prices rising at the fastest pace in decades.  Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - in the US stood at 6.4% in January. While that is lower than it was, it remains far higher than the 2% rate considered healthy, and Mr Powell said officials have been worried by recent data suggesting that progress could be stalling. He said that could push the bank to lift rates above the 5% to 5.5% officials had forecast in December.  Raising borrowing costs is one mechanism to slow price increases in the wider economy. \"The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,\" Mr Powell said in Congress during the first of two days of testimony on the economy.    \"If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,\" he added. The comments generated some pushback from lawmakers , especially those on the left.  They said the moves would do little to address causes of the inflation problem - such as the war in Ukraine and supply chain issues - while leading to an economic slowdown that will throw millions of people out of work.  \"You are gambling with peoples' lives,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, who also blamed the inflation problem on price-gouging by companies. Mr Powell said the economy would be in worse shape if the bank did not act.  US prices jumped an unexpected 0.5% from December to January, while monthly updates on retail sales and hiring have also been stronger than expected. By raising borrowing costs, Federal Reserve officials are hoping to reduce demand for loans for business expansions, homes and other purchases, ultimately cooling the economy and easing the pressures pushing up prices.  The moves have already led to sharp slowdowns in rate-sensitive areas of the economy, like the housing market. Mr Powell said officials would be looking carefully at incoming data as they make their decision. \"The upshot is that not only are interest rates set to rise higher than we previously anticipated, but there is a lot less scope for rate cuts later this year than we had originally thought,\" Andrew Hunter, deputy chief US economist for Capital Economics wrote in a note following the testimony.

It comes after the chain posted bumper profits for 2022, despite cost of living pressures hitting consumers.  The bakery chain has put up its prices several times in the last few years blaming rising costs.  Under the new plans Greggs, which currently has around 2,300 shops, aims to open more branches in airports, train stations, supermarkets and shopping centres. It also said it hoped to grow its total number of bakeries to over 3,000 in the coming years. The chain - which made profits of \u00a3148.3m last year - put its growth down to the \"value\" it was offering customers impacted by the rising cost of living. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is near a 40-year-high, forcing many consumers to cut back their spending or find way ways to cut costs.  However, the  cost of ingredients for Gregg's pasties and pies has been going up, along with its energy bills and staff wages.As a result, the chain's prices rose in 2022 and 2023.

Last year, the opening hours of 500 shops were extended until 20:00 or later and in 2023, Greggs said it planned to extend hours in 300 shops to 21:00. Greggs was first founded by John Gregg in the late 1930s when he began delivering yeast, eggs and confectionery on his bicycle to homes around mining terraces in Newcastle. The company then opened its first shop on Gosforth High Street in 1951 and the firm has gone onto to become a well-known brand.

People who are being priced out will \"have to compromise on the property type or location,\" he said.  It came as Foxtons  reported its annual profits had doubled in the past year.  Its lettings business saw particularly strong growth, with revenue up more than 17%.  Rising rents have been blamed for driving renters out of London. But Mr Gittins said a mismatch between supply and demand was the real problem.  \"The main issue is not affordability for the majority of the market - it's the stock issue,\" he told Radio 4's Today Programme.  Mr Gittins put the \"unhealthy\" supply and demand challenges down to recent policy decisions.  In its update to investors, Foxtons said the housing market relied on the availability of mortgage financing. It noted that interest rates had increased globally last year, with the UK impacted \"in particular\" by the government's \"mini-budget\" last September.  In the immediate aftermath, there was a drop in buy-to-let mortgage deals with many property investors reliant on interest-only mortgages hit by the volatility. Foxtons said this was likely to \"adversely affect affordability\" in the housing market.  He predicted the shortage in the market would continue for the next two to three years.  But Foxtons expects sales activity, which has slowed in the last six months, to improve in the latter part of this year.  \"Mortgage rates have started to reduce in recent weeks and buyer activity is picking up, which may result in a more favourable sales market in the latter part of the year,\" the company said in a statement. Rental site SpareRoom said the number of renters versus rooms available in London and its surroundings was higher this month compared to the same time last year.  According to its data, there were five active renters for each room available, versus two last March. The number was as high as eight per room in September 2022. \"The last 12 months has seen rents across the UK hit record highs and, unless new supply comes into market over the coming months, it's hard to see how those rents will come down,\" SpareRoom director Matt Hutchinson told the BBC.  \"High rents not only make it difficult for tenants who need to move now, it also means that many stay put to avoid paying more rent,\" he added.  Average UK house prices  fell in the second half of 2022 as buyers were squeezed by higher mortgage rates and living costs.  However, fresh figures from the Halifax suggest the situation has improved somewhat. Average UK property values increased by 1.1% on a monthly basis in February, it said, accelerating from 0.2% growth in January. Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, said: \"Recent reductions in mortgage rates, improving consumer confidence, and a continuing resilience in the labour market are arguably helping to stabilise prices following the falls seen in November and December. \"Still, with the cost of a home down on a quarterly basis (by 2.5%), the underlying activity continues to indicate a general downward trend.

Age UK said homes on prepayment meters pay more for gas and electricity than those on direct debit and risk energy being cut off due to a lack of cash. Energy firms have paused force-fitting prepayment meters until 31 March. But Energy UK, which represents firms, claims an amnesty could mean other households would pick up the cost. The issue of prepayment meters is under the spotlight after it emerged last month that debt agents acting for British Gas had broken into vulnerable people's homes to force-fit meters. It prompted the regulator, Ofgem, to ask suppliers to suspend forced installations. The regulator is also conducting a review into how prepayment meters are handled across the market.  A government spokesperson said: \"Ofgem is carrying out a review into the use of prepayment meters, but where one has been fitted and it is not suitable due to a customer's circumstance - such as if they are highly vulnerable - then it should be changed for a credit meter.\" Christopher Brooks, head of policy at Age UK, the charity for older people, told the BBC that the industry should use the opportunity to allow households to get rid of prepayment meters if they want to. \"We think everyone should be given the option to switch because prepayment meters have a higher cost attached to them,\" he said. \"It is often unfairly penalising some of the poorest people in our society and forcing them to pay higher costs for their energy.\" While some households choose to have a prepayment meter - as it allows people to pay as they go - others are forced into having them if they fall behind on their bills, while some inherit a meter from a previous tenant or property owner. The cost per unit of energy is higher than direct debit, because of the costs involved for suppliers. Once a pre-payment meter is installed it can be very difficult to have it removed, and there is no automatic review process to see if it's still the most appropriate payment method.  Many properties have a prepayment meter, or a smart meter in prepay mode because of a transfer of a previous tenant or owner, and it can be a slow and difficult process to be transferred.  Each supplier has a different procedure, they are likely to do a credit check, and may ask for a deposit of around \u00a3300 to remove the physical box.  It's often a shorter process for those happy to have a smart meter installed instead as companies may feel more confident customers will pay as the smart meter could be flipped back into prepayment mode.  Energy costs have soared, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding pressure to households struggling with the cost of living.  While Mr Brooks is seeking an amnesty for all people with prepayment meters, he highlighted there were 600,000 UK homes containing at least one person over 60 who are on a prepayment meter.  Age UK said it is \"extremely concerned about the impact of prepayment meters on older people living on low fixed incomes\".  Jackie Roeleveld, from Trafford, pays quarterly for her electricity but is on a prepayment meter for her gas - which she likes because it means she can't go over budget. But she is aware that friends of hers pay less for gas on direct debt.  \"It isn't fair, everybody should be paying the same rate,\" she told the BBC.  But Energy UK, which represents the energy suppliers, said a blanket approach to removing all prepayment meters from people's homes could result in those who are in financial difficulty falling further into arrears.  \"It's accepted that it's bad for customers to be falling further and further into arrears which is why suppliers are required to take steps to prevent it,\" said an Energy UK spokesman. \"In addition, it's likely much of these arrears will turn into bad debt - will never get repaid - which ends up going on other customers' bills.\" Ofgem said while moving a customer to prepayment meters \"must be a last resort\", it added that \"moves to stop prepayment meters risks leaving a serious financial blackhole\". \"Suppliers have a statutory right to recover debt - so a ban would force them to write off the debt, force other customers to pick up the tab or force government to cover the costs.\" We asked the seven largest energy providers (Scottish Power, British Gas, EDF, Shell, Octopus, EON and OVO, plus Utilita which has many pre-pay customers) to update us on their plans for future protection and redress of prepayment customers.  British Gas told us that as well as suspending warrant activity they are \"fully co-operating with Ofgem on their investigation and we will be contributing to Ofgem's consultation process on pre-payment meters\". EDF said that it changes customers from prepayment \"if it's not the right payment method for them\". \"However, we would need to agree an affordable and sustainable repayment solution with them, for example Direct Debit.\" Mr Brooks suggested that the government should introduce a cheaper social tariff, \"which essentially means a discount on people's energy bills for eligible customers\". He said the cost should be paid for out of general taxation. \"There is some degree of cross-subsidy so there is some cost that might be passed on to other customers, but in the grand scheme of things its probably not a huge amount,\" he said. \"It is definitely a fairer system than penalising some of the poorest people and making them pay more for their energy.\" Ofgem said the total value of household energy bill debt, which is money still owed after 90 days, reached \u00a32.5bn between July and September last year. It said that amount had jumped by \u00a31bn since the beginning of 2021.    Energy UK said it was necessary to look at how to ensure energy bill affordability in the future. \"That could well include a social tariff but what this would look like exactly, who would be covered, how would it be funded,\" said a spokesman for Energy UK.  \"So by all means let's look at that but should be wary of implying that a social tariff automatically deals with any issues around prepayment meters.\" 5 Minutes On podcast Prepayment meters - \"unfairly penalising the poorest\"Do you have a prepayment meter you would like removing?

The government said that it did not want to add to pressures on households. However, some groups said that after months of poor services and strikes, passengers are not getting value for money. About 45% of fares are regulated - they are directly influenced by the government. These include most season tickets, travelcards, and some off-peak returns. Train operators said fares needed to be set at an appropriate level for the rail industry and its customers. However, campaign group Transport Focus said \"too many passengers are not getting a value-for-money service\" and called for a fundamental reform of fares. Another campaign group, Railfuture, said higher fares were likely to push more people to work from home and called for rail fares to be frozen, or even dropped, as fuel duty has been.  The Scottish government is yet to make a decision on general fare increases and a proposed suspension of peak fares, while in Northern Ireland, public transport fares will rise by 7% from Monday. According to the Office of Rail and Road, the official rail regulator for Britain, train reliability is getting worse. It said 4.5% of all planned trains were cancelled between October and December 2022 - the highest since records began in 2014. Strikes and severe weather hit performance, it said. In England, the annual hike in rail fares is normally pegged to how quickly prices are rising, as measured by the Retail Prices Index the previous July, which stood at 12.3%. The government said the 5.9% rise was a \"fair balance\" between passengers and taxpayers who help pay for trains.  The Welsh government has also capped the increase at the same level. Deputy transport minister Lee Waters said he understood the rise was \"significant\", but added it had been kept \"as low as possible\". The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the government's decision to hold fares below inflation was \"understandable\". It said fares should \"appropriate\" for the industry and passengers. But passenger Mimi Kihumulendi described prices as \"extortionate\" compared with Europe. To commute from Reading to London for a year is nearly \u00a36,000, she said. \"Based on the service, they're not always on time, most of the time they're cancelled, delayed, you have to find other means to go there, and [fares] keep going up every year,\" she said. She said train firms need to explain how fare rises are improving the service. \"It doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"Most of the time you can't even get a seat on the train, so you're standing up, or missing that train to wait for the next one. \"How is it working so well around Europe where the fares are quite low and the service is quite good?

The average  increase of 5.9% arrives as the cost of living is squeezing households while strikes and poor rail services have irked some travellers.   Commuters might try to cram in their train ticket purchases before 5 March to avoid more expensive journeys, but here are five tips on getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year. Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance.  These types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey. Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London. Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale.  Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way. Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out. Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys.  Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.\u202f\u202f Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often. There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners.  For example, the regional Cotswold Line Railcard costs \u00a39.95, is valid for one year and gives you a 34% discount on off-peak single and return tickets. More information on the different types of railcard are  here. You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults.  The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket.  Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine. National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus.  The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance.  Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.\u202f  The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket,  according to National Rail. For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.

Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs, in the House of Commons.  It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. The Budget also includes big decisions on spending on health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered on  Wednesday, 15 March.It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight after.  After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The outlook for the UK economy in 2023-24 is slightly less bleak than it was last year.  But public finances remain fragile, with the soaring cost of living and massive support for energy bills driving up government borrowing. Mr Hunt has said this means he is unlikely to be able to make \"significant\" tax cuts.  However, he is under pressure to help struggling households and a number of measures could be announced. Energy support expected to be maintainedCurrently, the government is limiting the energy bill of a typical household to \u00a32,500 a year. This is due to rise to \u00a33,000 on 1 April.  However, the BBC understands that the chancellor is expected to keep the Energy Price Guarantee  at current levels for a further three months from April. Campaigners and opposition parties have pointed out that a fall in wholesale energy prices has sharply cut the cost of offering support.  Childcare support could be increasedAccording to the Guardian newspaper,  the Treasury is considering a plan to massively expand free childcare to one- and two-year-olds in England.  Parents of children aged nine months to three years would get 30 hours of free care a week during term time, subject to conditions. Currently the benefit only applies to children aged three and four. Fuel duty cut could be extendedAccording to  the Times newspaper, fuel duty could be frozen for a year.  Rishi Sunak cut the tax by 5p in March last year when he was chancellor, in response to record prices at the pump linked to the war in Ukraine.  This measure is due to end in March, with fuel duty predicted to rise by up to 23%. The state pension age could riseCurrently, men and women can start drawing their state pensions when they turn 66.  That is due to gradually increase to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and to 68 from 2044-2046.  But reports suggest a review into the state pension age will recommend that the increase to 68 be moved forward to the mid-2030s.  If true it would mean millions of workers born in the 1970s would have to push back their retirement plans.  It comes as Mr Hunt is trying to lure people over 50 back to the labour force to tackle worker shortages in many industries. The tax-free allowance on pensions could riseCurrently the so-called lifetime allowance - how much you can save in your pension pot before being hit with a tax charge - is \u00a31.073m, a level it will be frozen at until 2026.  With pensioners more likely to be dragged into paying tax, some may retire early, something Mr Hunt doesn't want.  He told older workers in a speech last month that \"we will look at the conditions necessary to make work worth your while\". Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK.  Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government published its last Budget on 15 December 2022 for the year 2023-24. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule  called the Barnett formula.

She says every time she comes out of her overdraft, \"it's a matter of weeks before I get straight back into it\". The government has increased funding for university students, but a new poll suggests students in England are having to juggle their studies with paid work. The online opinion poll, commissioned by social mobility charity the Sutton Trust with BBC News, suggests just under half (49%) of undergraduate students who responded have missed a lecture, seminar or workshop since September to do paid work. The findings also suggest: Almost a quarter (24%) of the students who responded to the Savanta ComRes poll have also missed a university deadline, or asked for an extension, in order to do paid work. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, says the opinion poll shows students are facing increased pressures due to the cost of living crisis. \"At the end of first year, I had three different jobs,\" says Heidi, who studies criminology with psychology at Leeds Beckett University. \"It caused a lot of stress. I worried about missing all those seminars.\" In December,  as prices and inflation continued to rise, she was working up to 45 hours a week to afford her rent. Heidi has since cut back on her hours, but still has two jobs - one at a music venue in Leeds city centre, and another in a coffee shop. Her rent is currently \u00a3107 a week, but it will rise from September, and her weekly bills are already going up. \"Shopping is a lot more expensive. I used to spend \u00a315 a week, now I spend \u00a325 or \u00a330,\" she says. \"Me and all my friends are struggling - money is always on our mind.\" Leeds Beckett University says it has committed its \"entire contingency fund\" of \u00a33.4m to help students who are struggling with the cost of living.

BBC News follows the lives of three university students in Leeds to find out how they are tackling the cost of living crisis. Available now on BBC iPlayer (UK only). The Sutton Trust is calling for the government to reintroduce maintenance grants and increase financial support.  This would mean \"low- and moderate-income students can fully partake in the university experience\", Sir Peter says.  Maintenance loans for students in England  are increasing by 2.8% from September.  But with inflation  at around 10%, student support is at its lowest level for seven years, in real terms,  according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. More than half (58%) of all students in England receiving a maintenance loan said it does not cover their living costs,  a study by the Office for National Statistics suggests. University of Portsmouth student Jamie Chevalier-Watts says it's \"a lot harder to budget this year\". The 23-year-old works in a bar and often finishes his shifts at 6am. He says he wants to put his coursework first, but has to miss lectures because he works long hours. \"I should be able to prioritise university and put all my energy into it, but even with the student loan, having to work is essential,\" he says. \"I have to work to make sure I'm paying rent and have a social life as well. \"It's not a great situation.\" A Department for Education spokesperson says it has made an extra \u00a315m in funding available for disadvantaged students, increasing the total to \u00a3276m this academic year.

Mr Hancock's spokesperson said: \"What has been accused here never happened.\" Mr Daly said he was \"very disappointed\" to learn about the exchange. However, speaking to BBC Radio Manchester, he said the threat was not carried out. Asked how he would have responded if such a conversation had taken place, the MP said: \"I would have told him where to go, and reported matters to a higher authority. \"To think somebody would use potential funding that could help someone vulnerable in our community to get votes for the government is just not acceptable.\"  Asked about the incident, Downing Street said Rishi Sunak would \"of course\" not want his ministers to behave in that way. \"There are rules and guidelines that apply,\" the spokesperson said.  Ex-Conservative Party chair Sir Jake Berry accused Mr Hancock of \"weaponising the provision of care to young disabled people\" and said it \"crosses a line of what's acceptable in public life\". He said the former health secretary had been \"drunk on power\". In messages leaked to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hancock's political aide Allan Nixon suggested putting pressure on MPs elected in 2019 whose \"re-election hinges\" on central government funding.  Mr Nixon proposed warning Mr Daly that funding for a new centre for disabled children and adults in his constituency would be \"off the table\" if he voted against new plans for a  stricter tiered lockdown on 1 December 2020.Mr Hancock replied: \"Yes 100%.\" Mr Daly told the Telegraph he was unaware the Department for Health and Social Care had plans to give Bury North a disability hub, which would provide specialists with a dedicated centre for co-ordinating local activity. Under the December 2020 tier scheme, every area of England was put into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. According to the paper, leaked messages show Mr Daly was more concerned with support for pubs in areas placed in the higher tiers because they were unable to serve food. Under the system, bars in tier two were only allowed to stay open if they served \"substantial meals\", while those in tier three could only provide takeaways or deliveries. MPs eventually backed the government's plans for the tier system by 291 votes to 78 despite a large rebellion by Tory MPs - including Mr Daly. Fifty-five Conservatives voted against the plan - the largest rebellion of then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson's time in No 10. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said the message exchange was an \"entirely partial account\". \"The missing context here is vitally important because this vote was critical for saving lives,\" the spokesperson added. \"What's being accused here never happened, demonstrating the story is wrong, and showing why such a biased, partial approach to the evidence is a bad mistake, driven by those with a vested interest and an axe to grind. \"The right place to consider everything about the pandemic objectively is in the public inquiry.\" The BBC has not been able to independently verify the messages.

After 26 years as Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West, Sir Graham said he wanted to leave while \"young enough to pursue other opportunities\". He said representing his hometown had \"been an immense privilege\". Born in Salford in 1967, Sir Graham first became active in the Conservative Party aged just 16 when - as a grammar school pupil - he joined a campaign to save local grammar schools. He studied law at Durham University before taking jobs at the think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, in public relations and later as public affairs director at a law firm. In 1997 - shortly before his 30th birthday - he was elected MP for Altrincham and Sale West in Greater Manchester, making him the youngest Conservative MP at the time.  He went on to serve as a party whip - the MPs who are in charge of party discipline - and his star rose as he served as a shadow education minister and parliamentary private secretary to then-Tory leader Michael Howard in 2003. As staunch supporter of Brexit, Sir Graham served as shadow Europe minister under David Cameron but quit in 2007 after Mr Cameron opposed grammar schools. In 2010, he was elected chairman of the 1922 Committee, a role he's held unchallenged for the past 12 years - the longest serving chairman in the committee's history. The group - known in Westminster as the \"men in grey suits\" - meets weekly and discusses the view of the party's backbench MPs. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady: I get asked about no confidence letters in the supermarket A man used to working behind the scenes, Sir Graham became something of a household name as the Conservative party elected then deposed four leaders in six years. One role of the chair of the 1922 Committee is to oversee the election of the leader of the Conservative Party. After his old boss, Mr Cameron stood down in 2016, he oversaw his first contest when Theresa May was appointed leader of the Conservative party, and so PM. He would go to run a record two Tory party leadership elections in a single year, when Liz Truss was appointed last year, only to be replaced by Rishi Sunak two months later. Sir Graham was also the one to collect letters of no confidence from disgruntled MPs, keeping the number a closely-guarded secret until the threshold to trigger a vote was reached. He oversaw the no confidence votes in both Ms May and Boris Johnson as their premierships began to crumble. The only reason he did not oversee the party's July 2019 leadership election - eventually won by Boris Johnson - was because he had stood down as 1922 chairman to consider a bid to become leader himself.  In the end decided against it and returned to his role two months later.  He said he plans to continue to serve as head of the 1922 committee \"until the end of the parliament, if they want me to\". Sir Graham - who is married with two grown-up children - was knighted in 2017. In a statement, Sir Graham said: \"Representing my hometown in the House of Commons has been an immense privilege for which I will always be grateful. \"I have decided to bring this fascinating and fulfilling chapter of my life to a close while I am young enough to pursue other opportunities and interests, so I will not be standing at the next election.\" ", "category": "politics", "source": "bbc", "summary": "\n\nAfter 26 years as MP for Altrincham and Sale West, Sir Graham Brady - who was chair of the 1922 Committee and oversaw the appointment of three prime ministers and two no confidence votes - has announced he will stand down at the next election in order to pursue other opportunities."}, {"title": "Dominic Raab's ex-colleagues speak out as bullying probe reaches final stages", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64834813?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "text": "This video can not be played Three former colleagues of Dominic Raab spoke to the BBC's Ione Wells about their experience of working with him. Former colleagues of Dominic Raab have spoken to the BBC about their experience of working with him, as an inquiry into bullying claims reaches its final stages. The investigation into the allegations against Mr Raab is being led by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC.  Dozens of people, including Mr Raab himself, have now given evidence to the inquiry.  The deputy prime minister and justice secretary has strongly denied bullying. Mr Raab's evidence is now being reconciled with other witnesses, in a sign the probe is approaching its conclusion.  Mr Tolley has been interviewing people to gather evidence, both positive and negative, with some interviews lasting more than two hours each.  His investigation is expected to conclude soon and was commissioned to establish the facts. It will then be for the prime minister to judge whether his findings show that Mr Raab broke ministerial rules on bullying or not.  The inquiry is investigating eight formal complaints from Mr Raab's time at three government departments, involving at least 24 complainants.  The complaints relate to Mr Raab's time as justice secretary and foreign secretary under Boris Johnson, and his time as Brexit secretary under Theresa May. Dozens more people have given evidence to the inquiry as witnesses.  The complainants cannot speak publicly while the inquiry is ongoing, but the BBC has spoken to a number of other people who worked closely with Mr Raab, who characterise his behaviour in different ways.  They wished to remain anonymous to not compromise their jobs. Somebody who advised Mr Raab in a senior role in one department said: \"I didn't personally feel bullied. I did observe though what I would characterise as bullying behaviour. There is no question in my mind about that.\"  They said he \"expected high standards of people\" but claimed he was \"pretty belittling in terms of how he would go about those things\".  \"And he would frequently humiliate members of his private office and/or others that are working with him,\" they said. \"At a flick of a switch he could turn incredibly angry and pretty offensive in the way in which he talked to people.\"  His conduct did not just impact colleagues, but taxpayers too, they say.  \"Junior officials were, to all intents and purposes, protected from being exposed to his nastiness, his humiliation, his belittling, and therefore would not be invited to go to meetings with him.  \"The effect was that he probably achieved something that no minister or secretary of state should try to achieve, which was to shut up those who are meant to be advising him. If you don't treat people humanely, fairly, with respect, the implications are that you're not going to get back quality outcomes.\"  One of Mr Raab's former parliamentary staffers says he was not a bully, but that reports about his behaviour have resonated with what they witnessed. \"There were a handful of occasions where I observed him make a member of staff cry, because he was not happy with their work. That was probably one of the things that I found most uncomfortable,\" they said.  \"I think if a colleague cries and they come back to their desk and they're still fretting, and that happens more than once, then I think anybody should recognise that somebody is hurt from that interaction.\"  \"If a member of his staff had delivered some work, which he didn't think was at the standard it should have been, he would tear it apart - frankly literally at times. I did observe that,\" they added.  \"The reason I left was the intensity of the job. I think both professionally and emotionally.\" Another parliamentary staffer that Mr Raab's office put us in touch with said they only had good things to say about him. A different official, who has given evidence to the inquiry and worked with Mr Raab in multiple departments, said even in the most challenging experiences they had \"never seen him swear or raise his voice\".  \"He was always very focused on his job, but always super nice, more perceptive than you'd realise,\" they said.  On hearing the news of the inquiry they said: \"I was sad because everybody's experience is clearly different and it didn't correlate at all to my experience in the slightest\u2026 I think people would admit he's hard work because he is a perfectionist and he will go above and beyond to deliver for a department he wants to make changes [to].\"  From people the BBC has spoken to, Mr Raab's behaviour seems to have had different impacts on different people. At times, similar descriptions of his behaviour are characterised very differently. That is the challenge for the lawyer investigating him.  The report of the investigation will be made public.  Mr Raab has said he will resign if he is found to have been a bully, a judgement Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have to make when presented with the facts.  He told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he was confident he was not a bully and \"behaved professionally throughout\".  His spokesperson has said that Mr Raab has been \"very clear that he has always acted with professionalism and integrity, that he has never shouted or sworn, that he has enjoyed strong working relationships with a range of fantastic civil servants, and that he will address all allegations put to him in the fair and formal setting of the independent inquiry that he called for\".

It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. The Budget also includes big decisions on spending on health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered on  Wednesday, 15 March.It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight after.  After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The outlook for the UK economy in 2023-24 is slightly less bleak than it was last year.  But public finances remain fragile, with the soaring cost of living and massive support for energy bills driving up government borrowing. Mr Hunt has said this means he is unlikely to be able to make \"significant\" tax cuts.  However, he is under pressure to help struggling households and a number of measures could be announced. Energy support expected to be maintainedCurrently, the government is limiting the energy bill of a typical household to \u00a32,500 a year. This is due to rise to \u00a33,000 on 1 April.  However, the BBC understands that the chancellor is expected to keep the Energy Price Guarantee  at current levels for a further three months from April. Campaigners and opposition parties have pointed out that a fall in wholesale energy prices has sharply cut the cost of offering support.  Childcare support could be increasedAccording to the Guardian newspaper,  the Treasury is considering a plan to massively expand free childcare to one- and two-year-olds in England.  Parents of children aged nine months to three years would get 30 hours of free care a week during term time, subject to conditions. Currently the benefit only applies to children aged three and four. Fuel duty cut could be extendedAccording to  the Times newspaper, fuel duty could be frozen for a year.  Rishi Sunak cut the tax by 5p in March last year when he was chancellor, in response to record prices at the pump linked to the war in Ukraine.  This measure is due to end in March, with fuel duty predicted to rise by up to 23%. The state pension age could riseCurrently, men and women can start drawing their state pensions when they turn 66.  That is due to gradually increase to 67 between 2026 and 2028, and to 68 from 2044-2046.  But reports suggest a review into the state pension age will recommend that the increase to 68 be moved forward to the mid-2030s.  If true it would mean millions of workers born in the 1970s would have to push back their retirement plans.  It comes as Mr Hunt is trying to lure people over 50 back to the labour force to tackle worker shortages in many industries. The tax-free allowance on pensions could riseCurrently the so-called lifetime allowance - how much you can save in your pension pot before being hit with a tax charge - is \u00a31.073m, a level it will be frozen at until 2026.  With pensioners more likely to be dragged into paying tax, some may retire early, something Mr Hunt doesn't want.  He told older workers in a speech last month that \"we will look at the conditions necessary to make work worth your while\". Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK.  Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government published its last Budget on 15 December 2022 for the year 2023-24. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rule  called the Barnett formula.

Ms Gray, who investigated parties held in Downing Street during the Covid pandemic, has been invited to become Sir Keir's new chief of staff.  Angela Rayner said Tory MPs were indulging in \"conspiracy theories\".  Boris Johnson and his allies have seized on Labour's job offer to claim Ms Gray's investigation into lockdown gatherings in Downing Street when he was prime minister was an attempt to smear him. Answering an urgent question in the Commons, Paymaster General Mr Quin said this was \"an exceptional situation, it is unprecedented for a serving permanent secretary to resign to seek to take up a senior position working for the leader of the opposition.\" He said there were four rules for civil servants that might have been broken, including informing the government appointments watchdog, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). \"The rules state that approval must be obtained prior to a job offer being announced. The Cabinet Office has not as yet been informed that the relevant notification to Acoba has been made,\" he said. Other rules that would be looked at by the Cabinet Office concerned impartiality, the declaration of outside interests, and contact with opposition parties being cleared with ministers, he added.  Mr Quin urged Labour to publish details of its communications with Ms Gray, including when these began and who was involved. Deputy Labour leader Ms Rayner accused a \"sleaze-addicted\" government\" of being \"so self-obsessed that they are using parliamentary time to indulge in the conspiracy theories of the former prime minister and his gang\". This video can not be played Angela Rayner and Jeremy Quin on Labour\u2019s job offer to civil servant Sue Gray. \"What will they ask for next, a Westminster Hall debate on the moon landings, the bill of dredging the Loch Ness, or a public inquiry into whether the Earth is flat?\" she asked. \"This debate says more about the delusions of the modern Conservative Party than it does anything else.\" But former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg - a close ally of Mr Johnson - suggested Ms Gray had \"smashed to pieces the idea of an independent civil service\" by \"conniving in secret meetings\" with Labour. Her Partygate report \"we now know was done by a friend of the socialists. Does this not undermine all her previous work?\" he asked.  Earlier, Sir Keir told LBC radio he had had \"absolutely no contact\" with Ms Gray, who left the civil service on Thursday, as she prepared her report into the lockdown gatherings in government buildings.  But the Labour leader repeatedly declined to say when he first approached the then senior civil servant about becoming his chief of staff. \"I've been looking for a chief of staff for a little while now, but Sue will lay that out, but there's nothing improper at all,\" he said.   Sir Keir added that he had known her since he was director of public prosecutions - a role he occupied from 2008-2013 - but she was not a friend.  Ms Gray was expected to tell Acoba on Monday when her contacts with Labour began.  An Acoba spokeswoman told the BBC this was a confidential process and no statement would be made until a new job was taken up, when its advice on an appropriate waiting period would be published. No timescale for the process was known, she added.   Senior civil servants, as well as ministers, are expected to check with Acoba about any employment they wish to take within two years of leaving government. The body provides advice and can recommend a delay of up to two years in starting a new job, but it has no power to block appointments.  However, Labour has said the party and Ms Gray will abide by Acoba's recommendations.  Earlier, Science Secretary Michelle Donelan said there was \"no reason to believe\" Ms Gray was not impartial when she carried out her Partygate investigation.  \"She was a leading civil servant who obviously swore and accepted the civil service code in which one of those key requirements is impartiality,\" she told Sky News. But, Ms Donelan added, the main concern was about \"what process has taken place for her to acquire this new job, have talks taken place when potentially they shouldn't have, etc?\"   Ms Gray  produced a highly-critical report into lockdown gatherings held in Downing Street while Mr Johnson was prime minister last year. Mr Johnson is now facing a different inquiry, being conducted by a cross-party group of MPs, into whether he misled Parliament when he said Covid rules had not been broken in Downing Street. In an  initial report published on Friday, the MPs on the Privileges Committee said the evidence they had seen \"strongly suggests\" Covid rule breaches would have been \"obvious\" to Mr Johnson. Ms Gray joined the civil service in the 1970s and has held a number of senior positions, including head of the government's propriety and ethics team.

He has insisted the DUP will take time before coming to a \"collective decision\" on whether to back the deal announced by the UK and EU. The panel will collate information and feed it into government discussions. The consultation group will also include MP Carla Lockhart, Lord Weir, Ross Reed, John McBurney and assembly members Brian Kingston and Deborah Erskine. It comes as government officials held separate talks with the Stormont parties on Monday about the new post-Brexit arrangements. The government is considering legislation to reassure unionists over Northern Ireland's constitutional place in the UK.  The government is also expected to provide more detail on how the so-called Stormont Brake is going to work.  It aims to give MLAs more of a say in how new EU laws will apply in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is not taking part in Monday's discussions. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is boycotting Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont until its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements are addressed. What does it tell us that two former DUP leaders have joined forces with the current leader to work out the party's next move?  It is partially about providing political cover to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson as he attempts to reach a collective position within his party on the new Brexit deal. The addition of DUP legal and business voices in the group is an attempt to cast the net wider than elected representatives. And we learned that a decision could come sooner than later, even by the end of this month, if all goes to plan. Sir Jeffrey denied that the panel opens up a pathway that could allow the DUP to set aside its seven tests on the deal and switch the focus to whatever this new group comes up with. But could it become a means to an end, and one which could ultimately see an end to the DUP boycott of power-sharing? Sir Jeffrey said he was putting in place a timeline of \"within the current month\" for the DUP to come to a clear view on the framework.  \"I'm not setting the end of March as the deadline I'm saying we want to complete our processes by then,\" he said.  \"I want to get this right however long that takes, it's important to get that right.\" He added that the upcoming 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement was in no way a \"factor in his thinking\" about coming to a decision on the deal.  The framework was signed to alter Brexit's Northern Ireland Protocol, and it was announced last week after months of talks. It will mean goods moving from Great Britain which are staying in Northern Ireland would use a \"green lane\" at Northern Ireland ports, meaning they should face minimal paperwork and no routine physical checks. Goods which are due to travel into the Republic of Ireland would use a \"red lane\", meaning they face customs processes and other checks. The brake would allow the assembly to raise an objection to a new goods rule. Meanwhile, former secretary of state Karen Bradley has described the Windsor Framework as \"phenomenal\".  Ms Bradley, who served under Prime Minister Theresa May four years ago, was co-chairing a session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly at Stormont on Monday. Members of the assembly met to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  The assembly includes MPs from Westminster, TDs (members of the Irish Parliament) and senators from Dublin, as well as a number of Stormont politicians and peers from Northern Ireland. She said: \"To actually have reopened that treaty and to be in a position where we have a different environment in which goods can move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, a different relationship - it is a real achievement. \"I just want the parties to get behind it to make it work and implement it.\" ", "category": "politics", "source": "bbc", "summary": "\n\nThe DUP is setting up an eight-member panel to come to a collective decision on whether to back the Brexit deal announced by the UK and EU, which includes two former party leaders and various other members."}, {"title": "Nitrous oxide: Laughing gas should not be banned, review says", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64869760?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA", "text": "This video can not be played Nitrous oxide is sold in metal canisters A review for the government has stopped short of recommending a laughing gas ban.Nitrous oxide, sold in metal canisters, is the second most-used drug by 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK. Heavy use can lead to a vitamin deficiency that  damages nerves in the spinal cord. But the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said nitrous oxide should not be banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.  It comes after the Home Office asked the ACMD to provide advice on whether to make possession of nitrous oxide a crime.  Earlier this year, ministers had been considering a ban on possession of the drug - and on all direct sale of it to consumers - as part of a move to tackle antisocial behaviour.  The ACMD recommended the substance should not be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.  It said sanctions for the offences would be disproportionate with the level of harm associated with nitrous oxide, as well as creating \"significant burdens\" for legitimate uses of the substance.  Nitrous oxide is regularly used as an anaesthetic in medicine and dentistry, and as a gas for making whipped cream in cooking.  Currently, non-legitimate use of the substance is controlled under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, which the council said \"remains appropriate legislation\".  The Act makes production, supply and importation of nitrous oxide for inhalation illegal, but not possession.

Every now and then, there are rumours that some big contentious piece of legislation - the long-awaited Small Boats Bill, maybe - will arrive and re-energise the atmosphere. We shall see. But there is the Budget to come, and the week after that, Boris Johnson is  due to give evidence to the Commons privileges committee into whether he misled MPs over Partygate.  In an update to its inquiry, the committee says the evidence \"strongly suggests that breaches of guidance would have been obvious to Mr Johnson at the time he was at the gatherings.\" In other news, senior deputy speaker Dame Eleanor Laing will be back in the chair this week, after several weeks recovering from surgery - during which time Sir Roger Gale has stood in.  Commons: Work and Pensions Questions from 14:30 GMT, with any urgent questions or government statements following at 15:30. Will some enterprising soul ask about senior civil servant and Partygate investigator Sue Gray being hired as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff?  The main debate will see MPs polish off the detail of the Social Security (Additional Payments) (No. 2) Bill, which authorises a means-tested additional payment of \u00a3900, in three instalments, to people receiving Universal Credit. Westminster Hall: From 16:30, MPs will debate a petition that opposes aligning the age exemption for NHS prescription charges with the State Pension age. The petition attracted 46,000 signatures.  Committees: Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16:00) begins what looks like a politically charged inquiry on electoral registration with evidence from academic experts and local council electoral registration officers.  Lords: Peers will debate the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill, in the fourth of eight days of committee stage.  Commons: It's Health and Social Care questions from 11:30. Conservative MP Anthony Browne will introduce a ten-minute rule bill that would require employers to pay contributions to a pension fund of the employee's choosing. In the main debate, MPs will deal with Lords amendments to the Public Order Bill. On previous form, the government will likely seek to overturn most of the eight defeats it suffered in the Lords, most of which place limits on the Serious Disruption Orders the bill would introduce. They will also debate two sets of regulations designed to ensure that the payments the government has been making to cut energy bills for people who heat their homes with alternative fuels, such as kerosene heating oil or biomass, are fully passed on to consumers. Committees: Education (10:00) opens its inquiry into persistent absence and support for disadvantaged pupils, which has risen sharply since the pandemic. They will hear from the children's commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, as well as trade unions and think tanks.  Health and Social Care (10:00) will quiz senior officials from NHS England on cancer referral waiting times. In January, more than 31,000 people had waited longer than the target of 62 days following an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer. I don't normally highlight public bill committees, but the one considering the detail of Lord Hayward's Ballot Secrecy Bill (09:00) is one for connoisseurs, because it is a rare example of a private member's bill from the House of Lords actually being considered in the Commons.   The bill, which has cross-party support, would ban the practice of family members accompanying voters into the polling booth to influence their vote. Lords: It's the second of two days of report stage scrutiny of the National Security Bill (14:30).  The main focus will be on government amendments to the proposed Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS). After considerable criticism, ministers have rewritten most of the contentious detail, although there is still some concern over clauses dealing with foreign contacts by political parties. This debate may produce the only contested votes of the week.  Commons: It's Women and Equalities Questions at 11:30, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. After this, Labour's Paula Barker will introduce her ten-minute rule bill on the national minimum wage.  This is followed by the Estimates Day debate. One of the stranger rituals in the Commons, these debates are supposed to allow MPs to consider the estimates of public spending by government departments. However, they have evolved into debates on select committee reports about specific issues, meaning they are not much of a mechanism for debating how public money is spent.  This time, they will focus on the spending of the Department for Education on childcare and early years. The key issue will probably be the cost of childcare, with the average price of full-time nursery care for a child aged under two now over \u00a3270 a week.\u202f The second debate sees Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee Chair, Clive Betts, focussing on spending on adult social care - which now accounts for two thirds of local council spending, with demand so great that it threatens the sustainability of local government finances.  At the end of the debates, the House rubber-stamps all the estimates, approving many billions of public spending. These are then translated into a Supply and Appropriations Bill, which will be whizzed through the Commons in a couple of microseconds on Thursday. Westminster Hall: Conservative MP Bim Afolami leads a debate on devolution and the future of the UK constitution (14:30). Committees: Northern Ireland (09:30) questions Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris on tackling paramilitary and terrorist activity in Northern Ireland. Human Rights (15:00) holds a one-off session on how the UK's human rights laws apply to assisted dying. Lords: It's day four of detailed committee stage debate on the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill (15:00). There's also a regret motion against some regulations - Labour's Baroness Twycross will argue that the Education (School Teachers' Qualifications and Induction Arrangements) (Amendment) (England) Regulations fail to deal with the continuing fall in the number of overseas teachers qualifying to work in England. Commons: From 09:30, it's Culture, Media and Sport Questions (minus Digital, after the latest government shake-up). It means questions on issues like broadband and online safety now have to be directed to the new Science, Innovation and Technology department.  There will also be questions to the MPs who speak for the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission, the Restoration and Renewal Client Board (in charge of sorting out the increasingly dilapidated buildings of the Palace of Westminster) and the Electoral Commission. That's followed by the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House. There's also (blink and you'll miss it) the Supply and Appropriations Bill (see Wednesday above).  The backbench debates will be International Women's Day and on Brain Tumour Research Funding.

They are central to the government's push to hit climate targets and lower energy bills. But to get the power from the new turbines into the national grid, a sprawling complex of cables and electrical facilities need to be built in a picturesque area of Suffolk. Some locals are furious, fearing \"a devastating cumulative economic, social and environmental impact\" - and they predict a political backlash at council polls in May and the next general election, with support for Tory councillors and local MP, Therese Coffey, threatened. There are versions of this bust-up across England, as Tory MPs struggle to balance government policy on net zero with the demands of constituents. For Environment Secretary Ms Coffey, it's  a particularly awkward dilemma. \"If you look to the left here, there's a fence with posters. That's my house.\" The house belongs to a resident of Aldeburgh, where the posters depict a village under siege by a \"threatened onslaught\" of energy projects. At the centre of this web of projects are two offshore wind farms approved by the government last year - East Anglia One North (EA1N) and East Anglia Two (EA2). To deliver the power they generate, the developer, ScottishPower, plans to bring cables onshore near Aldeburgh. The cables would weave underground towards a large industrial site known as a substation, where electricity can be transmitted further inland. Elizabeth Thomas says the 14m-high substation \"will dwarf\" Friston, the medieval village next door. Fearing traffic congestion, flood risk and the loss of farmland, the former teacher has been campaigning to move the substation elsewhere. Adam Rowlands is similarly dismayed by separate National Grid plans. National Grid wants to develop two major electricity links - Sea Link between Suffolk and Kent, and EuroLink between the UK and the Netherlands. As Suffolk area manager for the RSPB, a wildlife charity, Mr Rowlands is responsible for overseeing North Warren, a marshy nature reserve teeming with ducks, swans and geese. As we arrive at the reserve, a gaggle of geese swoop across the path of proposed underground cables, which Mr Rowlands says would \"damage\" the site and drive away birds. Addressing these concerns, National Grid tells us \"we give very careful consideration to all environmental and community impacts\". In the government's view, these projects are necessary to secure cleaner, cheaper power and end reliance on dirty, more expensive fossil fuels. Campaigners like Fiona Gilmore couldn't agree more - with one exception. The campaign she leads, Suffolk Energy Action Solutions, says much of this energy infrastructure should be put offshore on platforms connected to a single onshore hub at a disused site, closer to London. She says this offshore grid system would be cheaper and has already been used by Belgium. When we put this proposal to Mike Elmer, east coast programme director for National Grid, he said moving the onshore infrastructure elsewhere would pose significant practical, cost and time challenges. He said while National Grid continued to review offshore islands, infrastructure has to come onshore somewhere to deliver clean energy. Conservative councillor Craig Rivett, deputy leader of East Suffolk Council, says those suggesting alternative solutions, such as an offshore grid, needed to be clear about the \"technical, legislative and economic consequences to those proposals\". \"There is no silver bullet for us achieving energy security as a county and net zero,\" he says. The debate has pitted campaigners against energy developers, with Suffolk Coastal MP, Ms Coffey, sandwiched between them. In a petition, the environment secretary has called for a review of all onshore energy connections on the Suffolk coast. \"But if we don't get the offshore grid, and if this area is ruined, trust me, I think she's going to lose a lot of Conservative voters,\" Ms Gilmore says on Aldeburgh beach. \"Too right,\" says a passing dogwalker, eavesdropping on our interview. The sentiment is shared by Tony Bone who, as the chairman of Aldeburgh Museum, fears a huge downturn in tourism if the energy projects go ahead as planned. \"Suffolk Coastal has been a Conservative heartland,\" Mr Bone says. \"But I think people are changing their minds.\" In a statement to the BBC, Ms Coffey - who has a majority of over 20,000 - said she had been \"engaged in these issues from the very beginning\" and had \"consistently made it clear that it's essential our precious landscapes and communities are protected by placing the infrastructure in the appropriate location\". Ms Coffey said onshore connections should be placed on brownfield land and she would \"continue to press this point with National Grid and energy ministers\". She said she was \"disappointed\" her colleague, the climate minister Graham Stuart, hadn't yet committed to a full review of these projects. In a letter to communities in Suffolk last month, Mr Stuart said he didn't think a review was the way forward, as the government couldn't \"force changes\" to projects with contracts. Instead, he said his department was encouraging \"voluntary co-ordination\" of projects.  There are still legal hoops to be jumped through as well. Last month, a legal challenge against the decision to approve the EA1N and EA2 windfarms was granted permission to be heard in court. With local and national elections on the horizon, MPs and councillors are attuned to the political costs of these projects, as councillors say they expect the Tories to lose seats on East Suffolk Council in May. Back on Aldeburgh beach, Ms Gilmore says: \"I think that the whole of East Anglia is now up in arms.\" \"Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex - it's not just us. And we're not NIMBYs, we're actually progressive, forward-looking people.\" In a message to Conservative MPs in the region, she says: \"With a general election coming up, they've got to start listening to us - now.\" ", "category": "politics", "source": "bbc", "summary": "\n\nThe debate over the construction of energy infrastructure to connect offshore wind to the grid in a picturesque area of Suffolk has exposed the difficulty of balancing government policy on climate and constituents' demands, with potential political consequences for local Tory MPs."}]
